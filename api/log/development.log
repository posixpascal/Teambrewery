  Parameters: {"pokemons"=>[{"moveset"=>{"name"=>"Swords Dance", "description"=>"<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Acrobatics is Fletchinder's only powerful and reliable physical STAB move. Even though it is fairly weak, it gets priority thanks to Gale Wings, which transforms Fletchinder from a hopelessly outclassed NFE into a threatening and unique sweeper. Swords Dance raises Fletchinder's low Attack stat to high levels and allows it to sweep weakened teams. Will-O-Wisp gives Fletchinder a way to cripple Pokemon such as Rhyperior that would otherwise wall it, which provides it with quite a bit of early-game utility. It also lets Fletchinder have a much easier time setting up on physical attackers. Roost is used to give Fletchinder reliable recovery and to let it set up more easily.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given EV spread outruns 0 Speed Drapion and avoids the 2HKO from Assault Vest Escavalier's Knock Off. No item is used because using an item would prevent Fletchinder from having access to fully powered Acrobatics, severely hindering its effectiveness.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Don't attempt to sweep until you've worn down or removed Fletchinder's checks. Instead, if you bring out Fletchinder early-game, use Will-O-Wisp to spread burn onto Fletchinder's checks, such as Rhyperior and Alomomola. You should almost never be switching Fletchinder into an attack that is not from a weak defensive Pokemon or 4x resisted, as it is incredibly frail and might need to take a hit later on in order to set up. Once its counters have been removed or sufficiently weakened, Fletchinder can set up on a Pokemon that it forces out, such as Virizion, or one that cannot deal much damage to it, such as Escavalier.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Defog or Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Hitmonlee and Gligar is mandatory because of Fletchinder's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Grass-types are good teammates for Fletchinder because they can easily take on Rhyperior and bulky Water-types. Virizion, in particular, has great synergy with Fletchinder, as it resists all of Fletchinder's weaknesses. Magneton can lure in and OHKO Rhyperior with a Choice Specs-boosted Flash Cannon, is a good switch-in to Alomomola, and has great synergy with Fletchinder.</p>\n", "item"=>nil, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Will-O-Wisp", "desc"=>"Burns one adjacent target.

Thankfully, it has access to Swords Dance which helps to improve its damage output, as well as having support moves like Roost and Will-O-Wisp which allow Fletchinder to stay around longer despite its poor defenses and 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Will-O-Wisp also helps in terms of getting chip damage on some of Fletchinder's checks.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>This is the most viable set for Fletchinder, and it needs all the attacking power it can get, so running 252 EVs in Attack and an Adamant nature is the best choice. With priority Flying-type moves due to Gale Wings, Fletchinder doesn't need to run too much Speed, but 152 Speed allows it to outspeed and burn opponents like Adamant Honchkrow. Whatever EVs are left over should go into HP just to give Fletchinder a bit of bulk. With its only solid STAB move being Acrobatics, Fletchinder is better off running no item so Acrobatics gets 110 Base Power.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Fletchinder isn't something that can sweep on its own. To use this Pokemon effectively you should be eliminating its counters throughout the game and keeping it healthy for the late-game. Despite being frail, it will usually have an opportunity to set up a Swords Dance which will allow it to deal heavy damage to anything that isn't a check. Outside of being a late-game cleaner, Fletchinder can be useful throughout a match by revenge killing fast, weakened Pokemon with a priority Acrobatics.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Only having Will-O-Wisp and Acrobatics to inflict damage, Fletchinder needs quite a bit of help to sweep. Anything that can take out bulky Water-types is greatly appreciated. Such Pokemon include Magneton, Virizion, Celebi, Shaymin, and Cacturne. With a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, Fletchinder likes entry hazard control from Pokemon like Forretress, Empoleon, Crobat, and Mega Blastoise. Any Pokemon that benefits from having Fighting-types eliminated, such as Hydreigon and Scrafty, are great teammates for Fletchinder.</p>\n", "item"=>nil, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Acrobatics", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent or non-adjacent target.

However, Earthquake can be used instead to hit Pokemon like Raikou, Tentacruel, and Specially Defensive or CM variants of Jirachi for more damage. Scald is Gastrodon's other reliable STAB move, as it can cripple a lot of physical attackers, patching up Gastrodon's lackluster physical defense to make it more difficult to KO as an overall mixed wall. Toxic is a great utility move, as it can cripple common switch-ins, such as Jellicent and Swampert, that don't really care about Gastrodon's other moves. Ice Beam hits Dragon-types that it can switch in on with relative ease, such as Flygon, as well as Grass-types like Chesnaught. Recover is necessary, as without it, Gastrodon will not last as long.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs, along with a Bold or Relaxed nature, are to maximize Gastrodon's physical bulk, which is quite medicore when uninvested, and makes Gastrodon a great mixed wall thanks to its high HP stat and good Special Defense stat. A Relaxed nature should be used if running Earthquake, as Gastrodon can afford to run both physical and special attacks due to its horrific Speed. The HP EVs are to maximize Gastrodon's Leftovers recovery. Leftovers gives Gastrodon residual recovery each turn and can make it a pain to deal with, especially when coupled with Recover.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set takes advantage of Gastrodon's great mixed bulk, as even with base 68 Defense, it can still be very annoying for a good portion of physical attackers due to its access to Scald and its massive HP stat. Gastrodon also has the advantage of being able to switch into a very large portion of the Water-types in the tier, and can force some of them out with Scald and/or Toxic.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Fire-types, such as Victini, Darmanitan, and Mega Houndoom, who can force out a large portion of Grass-types are good partners for Gastrodon, and they can also bait Water-type attacks for Gastrodon to receive a Storm Drain boost. As Gastrodon is very susceptible to Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, a cleric can be used to increase its walling capabilities. Pokemon that have good defensive synergy with Gastrodon, such as Crobat, pair well with it. Crobat works especially well because it resists Grass-types, can break through Fighting-types such Scrafty and Mienshao, and can clear entry hazards that Gastrodon hates, mainly Toxic Spikes. Pokemon that can set up on Blissey and Florges, such as Toxicroak and Jirachi, are also great partners for Gastrodon.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Scald", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent target with a 30% chance to burn it.

Earth Power is a special Ground-type STAB move that hits Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Keldeo for good damage. Ice Beam hits Landorus, Dragonite, and Garchomp decently hard. Earthquake serves the same purpose as Earth Power and also derails Calm Mind users. Toxic is ideal for a wall like Gastrodon, as it slowly wears at the opponent's Pokemon. Recover is reliable recovery, and it helps rack up Toxic damage. Counter is an option as Gastrodon takes most physical hits very well, so Counter can nab some surprising KOs.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>252 HP EVs max out Gastrodon's HP, adding to its bulk, while 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature max out its Defense to handle threats such as Keldeo. Storm Drain gives an immunity to Water-type attacks, with a situational boost to Special Attack. Leftovers provides passive recovery. A Relaxed nature should be used if Earthquake is being used.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Gastrodon best functions as a physical wall that stays in to burn physical attackers or stall with Toxic to cripple opponents. Recover is best used to rack up Toxic damage on the opposing Pokemon. Gastrodon can switch into a predicted Water-type attack and get a free Special Attack boost, which guarantees Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp and Landorus. Gastrodon can also take hits from most physical attackers, so stay in on a physical attack and either attempt to burn the physical attacker with Scald or cripple it with Toxic.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>With Sludge Bomb, Mega Venusaur can counter opposing Grass-types, such as Breloom, which threaten Gastrodon. Ferrothorn can also perform this role, and makes up for not being able to counter Breloom with being able to set up entry hazards. Heatran counters most special attackers that can break through Gastrodon, and Gastrodon can take any Water-type move directed at Heatran. Chansey works well with Gastrodon, as it takes special hits with ease. Skarmory has good defensive synergy with Gastrodon, as Gastrodon takes both Electric- and Fire-type attacks for Skarmory, while Skarmory takes Grass-type attacks directed at Gastrodon, as well as being able to set up hazards.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Scald", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent target with a 30% chance to burn it.

The chance of burn is also very nice, considering the amount of physical attackers that switch in on Gastrodon. Scald can also defrost Gastrodon if it gets frozen by Kyogre's Ice Beam, which would otherwise render it helpless. Toxic is great for annoying and hindering Pokemon that try to come in or set up on Gastrodon; it is also especially good at crippling and pressuring Calm Mind Arceus variants that aren't carrying Refresh. Clear Smog is used to deal with Calm Mind Kyogre sets and other setup sweepers. Mirror Coat can be used as an alternative to Clear Smog as it bounces back huge amounts of damage to most special attackers that hardly inflict any damage to Gastrodon, such as Kyogre, Palkia, and some Calm Mind Arceus formes. Recover is Gastrodon's most reliable recovery move and can be used on the turn Kyogre switches out to maximize your chances of walling special attackers. Most of these moves punish the opponent for using Kyogre recklessly and will help with crippling and punching a hole in the opposing team.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum HP EVs should always be used to take advantage of Gastrodon's large bulk and maximize the amount of damage it can take. 120 Defense EVs allow Gastrodon to avoid the 2HKO from support Groudon and Low Kick Blaziken as well as the OHKO from +2 Life Orb Jolly Extreme Speed Arceus. 136 Special Defense EVs still allow Gastrodon to check Choice Specs Ice Beam Kyogre and wall other special attackers. A Calm nature is used to further increase Gastrodon's Special Defense. Storm Drain is the obvious choice of ability, as it provides a Water-type immunity and raises Gastrodon's Special Attack by one stage if hit by a Water-type attack. An EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD can also be used, as it allows Gastrodon to take even less damage from special attacks and maximizes its walling capacity, although this also renders it highly prone to Mega Mewtwo Y's Psystrike and physical attacks.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Switch in on Kyogre's attacks if you don't want serious damage done to your team. Gastrodon is extremely predictable, so change your switch-ins to Water-type attacks to keep your opponent from predicting you and outplaying you. Gastrodon is a Pokemon that absolutely hates hazards, especially Toxic Spikes. Try to keep hazards off your side of the field as much as you can to prevent Gastrodon from being worn down. Scout for any Grass-type moves you think the opponent might have, as Grass-type attacks are Gastrodon's only weakness.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Cleric support is highly appreciated by Gastrodon, as status can severely hinder its walling ability. Xerneas is a good cleric that works well with Gastrodon. Fire- or Flying-type Pokemon such as Ho-Oh are good teammates, as they cover Gastrodon's Grass-type weakness. Defoggers are also highly appreciated, as they remove entry hazards so Gastrodon can switch into Water- and Electric-type attacks freely without cost. Giratina formes are very good partners, as Giratina can wall physical attackers that Gastrodon doesn't like.

After one boost, Moltres's Speed is propelled to an insane 506, which allows it to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf base 105 Speed Pokemon. Flamethrower is used over Fire Blast because this set is mainly for mid- or late-game sweeping, which means Moltres can't afford to miss. Also, around that time in the game, most of the opponent's Pokemon would be weakened, so Flamethrower would clean up nicely. However, if you prefer the extra power, Fire Blast can be used over Flamethrower. Hurricane is Moltres's other insanely strong STAB attack that rounds out Moltres's near-perfect coverage. Roost is used to recover HP lost from resisted hits, Life Orb recoil, and Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Grass is a viable option over Roost, which allows Moltres to pick off weakened Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum Special Attack, a Modest nature, and a Life Orb ensure Moltres hits as hard as possible. This moveset only recommends 148 Speed EVs because that's all the investment that's necessary for Moltres to outspeed the entire tier after using Agility. The rest of the EV investment was placed into HP for a little bulk. You can always use a 252 SpA / 4 Def / 252 Spe spread if you want Moltres to outspeed Pokemon like Hitmonlee and non-Choice Scarf Rotom-C. Be wary of Rock- and bulky Water-type Pokemon like Slowking and Lanturn because they can wall this set. There's no need to ever run a positive Speed nature since you'll be increasing your Speed with Agility. The extra Speed may be nice but the drop off in power is noticeable.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This moveset functions just like the all-out attacking Life Orb moveset. The goal is to blast the opposing Pokemon with Moltres's extremely powerful STAB attacks after boosting Moltres's Speed with Agility. This moveset is best when used mid- or late-game, or after most of Moltres's checks and counters have been eliminated. For example, you would switch Moltres in on a resisted Grass-type attack from a Pokemon Moltres forces out, then boost its Speed with Agility as your opponent switches. It's also possible to masquerade as the conventional Life Orb wall breaking set in order to lure your opponent into a false sense of security. Your opponent is guaranteed to be stumped by this tactic, as their checks would be overwhelmed when matched against Moltres's insane Speed after using Agility.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Support from Substitute + Baton Pass Jolteon can prove to be very useful. With Substitute Moltres is able to avoid status moves and attacks, and set up Agility safely. Both Pokemon share decent synergy as Jolteon only has one weakness, which is to Ground. Moltres is a Flying-type Pokemon and is immune to the Ground-type moves aimed at Jolteon, so thanks to its typing, there's a higher probability Moltres will be passed a Substitute. Rotom-C is a great partner as well as it resists every one of Moltres's weaknesses. It's also able to remove some of Moltres's counters with its Grass- and Electric-type STAB attacks. It can also avoid Ice- and Fire-type attacks through the use of Volt Switch, which is a very effective way to switch Moltres in safely since Moltres can take Ice- and Fire-type attacks well. Moltres always needs a Pokemon that can rid the field of entry hazards. Hitmonlee and Shiftry are amazing offensive hazard removers that can eliminate Moltres's checks and counters and remove Stealth Rock at the same time. Hitmonlee's High Jump Kick is insanely strong and even 2HKOes Pokemon that resist Fighting-type attacks. Shiftry's ability to force out bulky Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon with its Grass-type STAB attacks and its overpowered Knock Offs is unmatched.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Roost", "desc"=>"The user restores 1/2 of its maximum HP, rounded half up.

Hurricane is its second STAB move that is only resisted by Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-type Pokemon. Flamethrower is a much more reliable STAB which can be used on weakened Pokemon or for a late-game sweep if you can't afford to miss. U-turn is used in order to scout and keep or gain momentum. Roost is also an option but when your opponent realizes you're Choice-locked into it, Moltres becomes setup bait. Tailwind can be a last ditch move that allows Moltres to support its teammates after being KOed.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A Choice Scarf mitigates Moltres's awkward Speed and allows it to beat its normal checks along with its Choice Scarf checks and counters such as Jolteon, Heliosk, Rotom-C, and Cobalion. A Modest nature is preferred over a Timid nature for some extra power, although a Timid nature allows Moltres to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom-C. U-turn is just a filler move and is used to gain momentum. As it won't be OHKOing anything, nothing wrong with a nature that lowers its Attack.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Choice Scarf Moltres can be used as an effective lead Pokemon. Choice Scarf Moltres also holds a bit of surprise factor because most people would assume it's a Life Orb or defensive variant. Its Choice Scarf allows it to get rid of its normal checks and counters, such as Jolteon, Cobalion with Stone Edge, Heliolisk, Virizion with Stone Edge, and Choice Scarf Rotom-C.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Moltres needs Rapid Spin support for every set it runs because of its severe weakness to Stealth Rock. Defog support is equally as effective as Rapid Spin is but at the cost of your own entry hazards. Hitmonlee is RU's best offensive spinner and does a great job of removing this set's counters.

Druddigon is a good teammate because it can eat the Water- and Electric-type moves that Moltres can't handle. Cobalion is also a great option that offers great hazard support with Stealth Rock and provides a nice Rock-type resist. Spikes-stacking Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Roselia, and Accelgor are also excellent partners for Moltres. Accelgor and Qwilfish should be utilized on offensive teams as suicide lead support Pokemon.

Fire Blast is Moltres's most useful STAB move, as it's capable of hitting a majority of the tier for large amounts of damage. Hurricane is Moltres's secondary STAB move that hits most things for great damage and covers most of the Pokemon that resist Fire Blast. Hidden Power Grass rounds out Moltres's coverage, and allows Moltres to hit Ground-, Water-, and Rock-types for super effective damage. Roost is handy, enabling Moltres to recover from Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage as well as resisted hits, increasing its longevity.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A Timid nature and maximum EV investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures that Moltres will hit as hard and fast as possible. It's also possible to give Moltres a Modest nature but it won't be able to outspeed Pokemon such as Rotom-C that it would normally. Life Orb adds to Moltres's exceptional power and is useful for ensuring Fire Blast and Hurricane attain crucial KOs. The 4 EVs in Defense instead of in HP will allow Moltres to switch into Stealth Rock twice without being KOed.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Because of Moltres's Fire / Flying typing, it loses 50% of its health every time it switches into Stealth Rock, which means Moltres should always be paired with a Pokemon who can remove entry hazards. Moltres also needs a teammate that can set hazards up as they are crucial to secure numerous OHKOs and 2HKOs. For example, after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, Assault Vest Slowking is 2HKOed by Hurricane.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Moltres needs a teammate that can clear the field of hazards because Stealth Rock cuts its health in half every time it switches in. Hitmonlee is RU's best offensive spinner because of its incredibly strong STAB move High Jump Kick, which allows Hitmonlee to eliminate hazard setters like Rhyperior and Druddigon. Shiftry is another Pokemon that shares great synergy with Moltres because of its ability to clear the field of all hazards with Defog, and at the same time, challenge Moltres's biggest counters, which are the tier's bulky Water-type Pokemon. Giving Moltres hazard support is just as important as pairing it with a teammate who can remove hazards. Druddigon is one of the best Pokemon to consider for a hazard supporting role, as with its great bulk and Dragon-typing, it's able to absorb Water- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Moltres. Druddigon is no sitting duck; it has a huge base 120 Attack and a plethora of moves that can take advantage of its sky-high Attack. Zoroark is another great option because of its ability to challenge Moltres's counters with its powerful attacks such as Knock Off, Grass Knot, Flamethrower, and Sucker Punch. Grass Knot allows it to beat Rock-, Water-, and Ground-type switch-ins and Knock Off devastates everything else. It's also able to masquerade as Moltres thanks to its ability, Illusion, and can confuse the opponent longer through the use of Flamethrower. Also, a Pokemon that can spread paralysis can also be very useful and it would make it possible for Moltres to beat Pokemon such as Cobalion, Virizion, and Delphox that outspeed it.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Life Orb", "desc"=>"Holder's damaging moves do 1.3x damage; loses 1/10 max HP after the attack.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"life orb"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Fire Blast", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent target with a 10% chance to burn it.", "type"=>"Fire", "category"=>"Special"}, {"name"=>"Hurricane", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent or non-adjacent target with a 30% chance to confuse it.

Flamethrower is used so Moltres is not completely shut down by Taunt or Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon who are immune to Toxic. Roost is a very important part of this set because it allows Moltres to recover HP lost from passive damage and resisted hits.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Pressure is an amazing ability, especially for a set like this one. With Pressure, Moltres is able to limit the amount of PP a Pokemon has, which can prove to be very useful when used with Roost and Substitute. This moveset is difficult for bulky offensive and balanced teams to break through without losing a lot of PP or being crippled by Toxic. Leftovers are essential because they provide Moltres with much needed passive recovery. This moveset is geared to take advantage of Pressure and Moltres's great resistances, in order to Toxic stall the opponent. Moltres is given a Timid nature and 136 Speed EVs in order to outspeed everything up to Adamant Hitmonlee. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Defense to give Moltres as much bulk as possible. The 124 Defense EVs can easily be moved to Special Defense to handle an uninvested Scald from Lanturn or Slowking.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Defensive SubRoost Moltres is best if used on a balanced, stall, or semi-stall team. Moltres is fast for a defensive Pokemon so it'll have the advantage against most of the tier's other defensive Pokemon. This is essential for this set because it's built to take advantage of Moltres's ability to PP stall with Pressure and wear down the opponent with Toxic. Moltres can switch in on many common defensive Pokemon such as Aromatisse, Amoonguss, Bronzong, Gligar, and Registeel, and then proceed to Toxic stall the aforementioned Pokemon and more into submission.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Like every Moltres moveset, this one needs a bulky Pokemon who can remove hazards. Hitmontop is a great defensive hazard remover. Hitmontop has great Defense and its ability, Intimidate, helps it when dealing with top-tier physical threats. Intimidate can also make it easier for Moltres to deal with physical threats. Hitmontop's Special Defense is also very high, so it's able to take Electric- and Water-type attacks aimed at Moltres. A powerful Ground-type Pokemon who can set up hazards would also be appreciated because it's able to get rid of Poison-type Pokemon who are immune to Toxic. Dragalge can also be a great supporting teammate because it can take the Water- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Moltres, as well as spread poison around with Toxic Spikes, thus making it easier for Moltres to Pressure stall the opponent. Drapion is also a great option for a defensive Toxic Spikes stacking Pokemon. A Pokemon with the ability to phaze opposing Pokemon is useful too, along with a Toxic Spikes stacking Pokemon and Moltres.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Substitute", "desc"=>"The user takes 1/4 of its maximum HP, rounded down, and puts it into a substitute to take its place in battle.

Substitute provides protection from status, which otherwise cripples Moltres, and is easy to set up thanks to Moltres's handy resistances. Any defensive Pokemon worth its salt loves a form of recovery; Roost provides this longevity for Moltres. Toxic is a great way to cripple common switch-ins, especially bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Azumarill. Finally, Flamethrower is a decently strong STAB attack that has the added advantage of denting many Pokemon that don't mind Toxic, such as Steel-types, Mega Venusaur, Poison Heal Gliscor, and Celebi.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given EVs and Calm nature emphasize special bulk, allowing Moltres to check the likes of Alakazam, Landorus, and Mega Charizard Y, while also minimizing Stealth Rock damage and allowing Moltres to outspeed Adamant variants of Bisharp and Breloom. Leftovers is the item of choice for its useful HP restoration.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set is designed to stall out opposing Pokemon with passive damage from Toxic while keeping healthy with Roost. Moltres should try to set up a Substitute on Pokemon that cannot break it, such as Gliscor, or when it is expected that the opponent will switch out. A good example of when to use Substitute is if Moltres is on the field against a Ferrothorn. Keep in mind that if Moltres is not safely behind a Substitute, Toxic should nearly always be used to hit Water-types as they switch in, which will force Moltres out otherwise. It is also important to remember that Pressure will double the PP cost of moves used against Moltres, so it is feasible to stall out the PP of moves such as Stone Edge or Hydro Pump through the use of Substitute and Roost. Because Stealth Rock takes a huge 50% of Moltres's HP upon switching in, you should play cautiously when it is on the field, as using Substitute once before switching out will make Moltres only useful as death fodder unless you've previously removed Stealth Rock. Although this set invests in Special Defense, Moltres's typing allows it to check physical attackers, too. Scizor and Conkeldurr can do very little outside of Knock Off, and Ground-types such as Excadrill that lack a Rock-type coverage move will be completely shut down.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This Moltres set is best suited for defensively inclined or balanced teams. In order for it to be effective, Defog or Rapid Spin support is a necessity; Excadrill has nice defensive synergy with Moltres and can demolish Tyranitar and Heatran with its STAB Earthquake. Mega Blastoise coves Moltres's Water-type vulnerability and Moltres can comfortably switch into Grass-type attacks aimed at Mega Blastoise. As far as Defog users go, Latios is an excellent choice, particularly variants carrying Earthquake, as they effectively lure and remove Heatran and deal nice damage to Tyranitar. Defensive, bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Gourgeist-XL are great partners as they can switch into Electric- and Water-type moves. In return, Moltres can check Fire-type threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Teammates that can handle fast physical attackers such as Terrakion, Garchomp, and Talonflame are wise choices; Landorus-T and Rotom-W are effective in this pivot role and can often bring Moltres in safely with U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively. Landorus-T can also set up Stealth Rock to wear down opposing Pokemon.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Substitute", "desc"=>"The user takes 1/4 of its maximum HP, rounded down, and puts it into a substitute to take its place in battle.

Solar Beam's synergy with Sunny Day is self-explanatory, and it lets Moltres bypass some of its most common checks too, OHKOing Rhyperior and 2HKOing Assault Vest Slowking, Regirock, and Lanturn. Morning Sun heals an astounding 66% of Moltres' HP whenever sun is in effect, allowing Moltres to heal off Life Orb recoil and use Pressure in order to stall out the Water-type moves weakened by the sun. Roost is an option over Morning Sun, since the latter's low PP might be undesired, especially when games drag on for longer. However, Roost's higher PP and secondary effect of removing Moltres's Flying typing temporarily are usually unneeded making it an inferior option overall.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The chosen EV spread is standard on offensive Pokemon, with a Timid nature to make use of Moltres's respectable Speed tier. The Special Attack investment coupled with a Life Orb gives Moltres all of the firepower it needs to fulfill its role properly.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Moltres set functions best as a lure and wallbreaker, using its high-powered Fire Blast, Solar Beam's coverage, and Morning Sun's recovery in order to plow through entire slower teams. Despite having Sunny Day in its moves, Moltres is meant to be used as a standalone sweeper, and not as a dedicated supporter for Chlorophyll sweepers, similarly to how sets such as Trick Room Reuniclus and even Rain Dance Ludicolo work. Moltres is a little less useful against faster teams, but it can still make use of its decent defensive typing in order to find switch-in opportunities and proceed to punch holes through the enemy team. Even if Moltres doesn't have the opportunity to set up Sunny Day, it can still function outside of sun.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>As with any Moltres variant, entry hazard removal through either Defog or Rapid Spin is a must for its effectiveness. Skuntank, Gligar, and Kabutops are usually fit for that job. Due to its prowess as a wallbreaker, Moltres also benefits from entry hazards of its own; the likes of Cobalion and Qwilfish can easily set these up, while also possessing good synergy with Moltres. As for offensive partners, Pokemon that benefit from Moltres's ability to lure Rock-types, such as Cinccino and Delphox, as well as Chlorophyll sweepers that benefit from both the sun and the holes Moltres punches, such as Shiftry and Victreebel, are all good teammates. As for more defensively-oriented options, Pokemon that can check the Fire-types that might abuse Moltres's own sun, such as Regirock and other Rock-types, are fine options. Water-types can be used too, but it's not recommended, since the sun weakens their STAB moves. Lastly, Cresselia is an outstanding option with this Moltres set, due to their amazing synergy. Moltres's Sunny Day boosts Cresselia's Moonlight, while Cresselia provides Moltres with Thunder Wave and Lunar Dance support.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Life Orb", "desc"=>"Holder's damaging moves do 1.3x damage; loses 1/10 max HP after the attack.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"life orb"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Sunny Day", "desc"=>"For 5 turns, the weather becomes Sunny Day.

With the given EV spread, Slowking can absorb any of Landorus's attacks and have more than a 50% chance to KO it with Scald. Fire Blast allows Slowking take down Ferrothorn and Skarmory with relative ease and always KO Bisharp that lack investment in bulk. Future Sight is an excellent option combined with a Pokemon such as Azumarill that lures in Mega Venusaur or Bisharp that lures in Keldeo to put them in a checkmate position, as they cannot effectively check those Pokemon due to the threat of Future Sight. Dragon Tail, meanwhile, stops special setup sweepers such as Manaphy. The EV spread and Assault Vest allow Slowking to survive a +6 Energy Ball from Manaphy and force it out. Psychic is the best way to hit Mega Venusaur, which is commonly physically defensive, and allows Slowking to easily take down Keldeo. Power Gem allows Slowking to KO Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame in almost any situation. Thundurus is hit hard by Power Gem as well and never survives two hits. Alternatively, Ice Beam is a very solid way to deal with the Dragons in OU and hits Gliscor and Landorus harder than Scald.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>With the EV spread presented, Slowking avoids a 2HKO from Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam. The Special Attack investment allows Power Gem to knock out Talonflame and Charizard Y while also knocking out Bisharp with Fire Blast. A Modest nature increases Slowking's power, allowing it to fire back hard; a Quiet nature should be used if Dragon Tail is run in order to retain maximum damage. As Slowking is rather slow to begin with, the little bit of Speed that is lost is negligible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Slowking's bulk allows it to pivot into and threaten just about any special attacker. Its special bulk and good movepool allow it to be a very useful defensive pivot, applying pressure to the majority of the opponent's team. It can also scout most special attackers due to this major special bulk and regain a lot of health with Regenerator by pivoting in and out as a scout. However, when playing against Mega Charizard Y, it is advised that you be wary of using Slowking as a check, as Solar Beam can still take a great deal of its health. Pivot switches to get Slowking into a Fire Blast may be useful. Watch out for Knock Off on Landorus, too.</p>\n<p>Slowking does have the ability to take on some mixed attackers, but leaving Slowking in on most physical attacks is unwise. Bisharp is an especially large nuisance, as it is able to OHKO Slowking with Knock Off or trap it with Pursuit.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Slowking appreciates Pokemon that can cover its Electric-, Bug-, and Dark-type weaknesses, so Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, which can absorb these attacks with relative ease, make for great teammates. Chesnaught has near-perfect type synergy with Slowking, as it resists Dark and Electric and is immune to Shadow Ball thanks to Bulletproof. Chesnaught's physical bulk coupled with Slowking's special bulk makes them even more compatible. Conkeldurr resists Dark-type attacks and is bulky enough to take many physical hits that would bother Slowking. Due to Slowking's Psychic resistance and special bulk, the benefits are mutual. Lastly, Slowking synergizes well with cleric Fairy-types due to its Steel resistance and their resistances to Bug and Dark. Furthermore, Slowking can only heal by switching and cannot get rid of status, so cleric support from Clefable or Sylveon is much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Partners to take advantage of Future Sight are vital to utilizing it effectively. Some examples of Pokemon that don't enjoy taking a Future Sight include Mega Venusaur, Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Landorus-T, so Pokemon such as Azumarill, Keldeo, Bisharp, and Garchomp that can lure some of these Pokemon in make for effective partners. Bisharp is an especially effective partner because it threatens Chansey and can break through common foes like Gliscor, Skarmory, and Quagsire with the aid of Future Sight.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Assault Vest", "desc"=>"Holder's Sp.

A Modest nature increases Slowking's power, allowing it to fire back hard; a Quiet nature should be used if Dragon Tail is run in order to retain maximum damage. As Slowking is rather slow to begin with, the little bit of Speed that is lost is negligible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Slowking's bulk allows it to pivot into and threaten just about any special attacker. Its special bulk and good movepool allow it to be a very useful defensive pivot, applying pressure to the majority of the opponent's team. It can also scout most special attackers due to this major special bulk and regain a lot of health with Regenerator by pivoting in and out as a scout. However, when playing against Mega Charizard Y, it is advised that you be wary of using Slowking as a check, as Solar Beam can still take a great deal of its health. Pivot switches to get Slowking into a Fire Blast may be useful. Watch out for Knock Off on Landorus, too.</p>\n<p>Slowking does have the ability to take on some mixed attackers, but leaving Slowking in on most physical attacks is unwise. Bisharp is an especially large nuisance, as it is able to OHKO Slowking with Knock Off or trap it with Pursuit.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Slowking appreciates Pokemon that can cover its Electric-, Bug-, and Dark-type weaknesses, so Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, which can absorb these attacks with relative ease, make for great teammates. Chesnaught has near-perfect type synergy with Slowking, as it resists Dark and Electric and is immune to Shadow Ball thanks to Bulletproof. Chesnaught's physical bulk coupled with Slowking's special bulk makes them even more compatible. Conkeldurr resists Dark-type attacks and is bulky enough to take many physical hits that would bother Slowking. Due to Slowking's Psychic resistance and special bulk, the benefits are mutual. Lastly, Slowking synergizes well with cleric Fairy-types due to its Steel resistance and their resistances to Bug and Dark. Furthermore, Slowking can only heal by switching and cannot get rid of status, so cleric support from Clefable or Sylveon is much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Partners to take advantage of Future Sight are vital to utilizing it effectively. Some examples of Pokemon that don't enjoy taking a Future Sight include Mega Venusaur, Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Landorus-T, so Pokemon such as Azumarill, Keldeo, Bisharp, and Garchomp that can lure some of these Pokemon in make for effective partners. Bisharp is an especially effective partner because it threatens Chansey and can break through common foes like Gliscor, Skarmory, and Quagsire with the aid of Future Sight.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Assault Vest", "desc"=>"Holder's Sp.

Psyshock is Slowking's other STAB move, hitting specially defensive Pokemon such as Roserade and Florges on their weaker Defense stat. Dragon Tail is one of the big selling points of Slowking, as it can phaze Pokemon, hindering setup sweepers as well as possibly inflicting further damage with entry hazards. Ice Beam and Fire Blast are both able to hit the Grass-types that Slowking tends to attract. Ice Beam is generally more useful, as it is able to hit Hydreigon and other Dragon-types super effectively. Fire Blast, however, deals much more damage to Steel-types, such as Forretress, Cobalion, and Escavalier.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Assault Vest boosts Slowking's excellent Special Defense to even greater heights, letting Slowking sponge a multitude of special attacks, even most of the ones it's weak to. Regenerator makes Slowking incredibly hard to wear down, restoring 33% of its HP upon switching out. The given EV spread maximizes Slowking's HP while giving it as much of an offensive presence as possible with the leftover EVs placed into Special Defense, as even without investment, Slowking's Special Defense is staggeringly high with Assault Vest equipped. However, if Slowking needs to take special attacks more easily, an alternate spread of 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 SpD can be used to maximize Special Defense while allowing Slowking to OHKO offensive Roserade with Psyshock. A Quiet nature with 12 Attack EVs can be used so that Dragon Tail is able to reliably break Kingdra's Substitutes. Focus Blast can be used in the fourth moveslot to hit Dark- and Steel-types switching in, but be wary of its shaky accuracy. Grass Knot can also be used if your team requires support against bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Mega Blastoise, though it isn't useful for much else.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Slowking set functions as an offensive pivot that doubles as a special tank, so it's best used when switching in on special attackers it's effectively able to check, sponging a hit, and responding with the appropriate coverage move. Pokemon such as Noivern, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Starmie, and Porygon-Z are effectively checked by this set. Because of its ability Regenerator, switching in and out with Slowking is actually encouraged as it replenishes HP, offsetting damage taken from entry hazards, weaker or resisted attacks, and status. Thanks to Dragon Tail, Slowking is able to check most Calm Mind users in the tier and force them out. This allows it to keep them at bay, repeatedly deterring setup throughout the early- and mid-game phases. Assault Vest Slowking can even survive special attacks it's weak to in a pinch, including STAB moves from Chandelure, Roserade, Hydreigon, Rotom-H, Mega Houndoom, and Raikou, though it's not advised to let Slowking take these attacks unless Slowking is able to take out the attacker immediately afterward. For the most part, it's best to have a backup special wall to handle the aforementioned special attackers, which Slowking prefers not to deal with.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Because this set is more of an offensive pivot that doubles as a special tank, backing from a specially defensive Pokemon that can handle special moves it normally doesn't want to take is helpful. Umbreon and Florges are both valuable, as they both cover some of Slowking's weaknesses. Florges is especially notable, as it can sponge Dark- and Bug-type moves for Slowking, while Slowking can check Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Chandelure for Florges. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, defensive Mega Ampharos, and Arcanine can form a defensive core with Slowking to cover physical and special attacks, taking the physical moves that Slowking otherwise falls victim to. These Pokemon are also notable for their ability to take Knock Off, a move that Slowking fares poorly against. Slowking has issues breaking through Florges, even with Psyshock, and Florges can't be forced out due to its immunity to Dragon Tail; partners who can take out Florges for Slowking, such as Crobat, Nidoking, Darmanitan, and Cobalion, are much appreciated. Because Slowking is able to phaze the opponent's Pokemon with Dragon Tail, entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish, Roserade, Chesnaught, Forretress, Donphan, and Mega Aggron are suitable partners, as the support they offer helps wear down the opposing team. Other Pokemon with Regenerator, such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Mienshao, can form an annoying Regenerator core that outlasts the opponent's Pokemon through constant switching.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Assault Vest", "desc"=>"Holder's Sp.

Psyshock is a reliable secondary STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Roselia resist Slowking's other STAB move while helping in winning Calm Mind wars. However, Fire Blast can be used for a stronger hit on Escavalier and Grass-type switch-ins. Calm Mind gives Slowking sweeping potential, giving it much-needed power and making it nearly unbreakable on the special side. Slack Off gives Slowking reliable recovery and keeps Slowking healthy while it sets up.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>248 HP EVs give Slowking a Stealth Rock number that minimizes the residual damage it takes. Max Defense investment with a Bold nature is used to take physical attacks well while setting up with Calm Mind. Leftovers is the item of choice, letting Slowking heal some damage without having to use Slack Off too frequently.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Slowking can still take most special hits decently thanks to its natural bulk and can shrug them off with Calm Mind, so you can use it early- or mid-game as a pivot because Regenerator will keep it healthy. You should set up late-game when Dark-type Pokemon and strong physical attackers are gone, as they can easily overpower Slowking while it sets up. This set also hates Toxic, so you should be careful against Alomomola and Bronzong, which commonly use the move.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This Slowking works well as a win condition in stall teams but it is a nice fit on balanced teams too thanks to its good mixed bulk and ability to form defensive cores with a lot of Pokemon. Physically defensive Aromatisse can take Dark- and Bug-type attacks well and cure Slowking from Toxic with Aromatherapy. Other physical walls such as Gligar are also useful to take on the physical attackers that threaten Slowking, namely Hitmonlee, Drapion, Skuntank, and Doublade. Toxic Spikes support is incredibly useful for Slowking to outlast other Calm Mind sweepers and walls. Roselia and Drapion are good users of the move and can also absorb Toxic Spikes on entry.

Psyshock is necessary to hit Pokemon such as Florges and Roserade on their weaker physical Defense stat. Ice Beam and Fire Blast both hit the Grass-types that check Slowking; Ice Beam also nails Hydreigon and other Dragon-types, while Fire Blast immediately dispatches Steel-types such as Forretress, Cobalion and Escavalier. Trick is preferred for the last moveslot, as crippling special walls such as Florges, Umbreon, and Snorlax can prove to be invaluable in helping Slowking or its teammates, though Focus Blast allows Slowking to deal serious damage to Dark-types switching in. Grass Knot can also be used in the fourth moveslot if your team requires more support against bulky Water-type Pokemon; with Choice Specs, it's capable of nabbing a 2HKO on Mega Blastoise, Jellicent, Suicune, and Swampert.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>With a Modest nature and Choice Specs, Slowking reaches the full potential of its strength. Regenerator is Slowking's best ability, giving it access to reliable recovery while dealing damage throughout a match. The EVs listed give Slowking as much bulk and power as possible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Be advised that this set is significantly less bulky than the Assault Vest set, so Slowking's ability to switch in and out on attacks is reduced. With Regenerator, Slowking differentiates itself from other Choice item users, as they get worn down as they switch in and out repeatedly to change attacks, while Slowking receives 33% of its HP back when it switches out. This greatly eases the punishment associated with predicting incorrectly, though bear in mind that this doesn't grant Slowking absolute freedom to use any move; Slowking, like any other Choice item user, still relies heavily on using the correct move to put pressure on the opponent. On top of this, Slowking is slow, meaning it also depends on either hitting a Pokemon switching in or taking a blow and retaliating. Due to the surprise value of Trick, it's best to use the move after revealing to the opponent that Slowking is holding Choice Specs, as special walls like Umbreon and Florges will be much more likely to switch in on Slowking in the hopes of forcing it out and getting free turns.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Choice Specs Slowking's hit-and-run nature lends it to being switched in and out numerous times, so partners that can cover its weaknesses allow it to constantly switch in much more easily. Grass-types such as Roserade, Shaymin, and Amoonguss can take the Grass- and Electric-type moves aimed at Slowking. Dark-types such as Hydreigon, Umbreon, and Mega Houndoom can switch in on the Dark- and Ghost-type moves directed at Slowking; the former two also check most Electric-type attackers while all three can check most Grass-types. Pokemon that can take the Bug- and Grass-type moves aimed at Slowking such as Chandelure, Arcanine, and Crobat are appreciated, as are Ground-types like Hippowdon, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Swampert, which can absorb the Electric-type moves that Slowking is weak to. In return, Slowking can check most of the bulky Water-type Pokemon that give these Pokemon trouble, especially if it opts to run Grass Knot.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Choice Specs", "desc"=>"Holder's Sp.

Thunder Wave cripples fast attackers on the switch and Toxic helps with bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Alomomola, but most switch-ins are crippled more by the paralysis from Thunder Wave and the burn from Scald, so it is usually inferior. Slack Off gives Slowking reliable recovery and keeps Slowking healthy when it can't afford to switch out. It also helps to stall if you are running Toxic. Dragon Tail is useful to beat most Calm Mind sweepers such as Reuniclus.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>248 HP EVs give Slowking a Stealth Rock number that minimizes residual damage. 184 EVs in Special Defense let Slowking avoid the 2HKO from Timid Life Orb Moltres's Hurricane.

Abuse Regenerator to keep Slowking healthy and spread status without being worn down. Scald is usually the best move to go for on predicted switches as neither of Slowking's checks, such as Drapion or Skuntank, appreciate a burn too much. This Slowking can take some physical hits thanks to its investment in Defense, but strong physical attacks will leave a big dent in Slowking, so switching out in front of strong physical attackers is usually the best option.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Aromatisse, which takes Dark- and Bug-type attacks and can get rid of status with Aromatherapy, is a very good partner and makes a strong core with Slowking. Registeel can set up Stealth Rock and walls most special attackers Slowking can't deal with very well such as Exploud while appreciating Slowking's ability to wall Fire-types. Weezing can set up Toxic Spikes, freeing a slot for an additional attack or Dragon Tail, and takes most of the physical hits that trouble Slowking really well thanks to its stellar physical bulk. Drapion can set up Toxic Spikes too and can help with Psychic-type Pokemon such as Cresselia and Reuniclus, as it can phaze them if they try to set up on Slowking or hit them hard with STAB Knock Off. Gligar and Golbat, which appreciate having some of their weaknesses covered and can wall physical threats, are also good partners and the Defog support they provide is also useful as multiple layers of Spikes can nullify Regenerator. Finally, Amoonguss and Roselia resist Slowking's Electric and Grass weaknesses and the former can form a Regenerator core that is very hard to take down while the latter can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Scald", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent target with a 30% chance to burn it.

Scald is preferred over Surf for the potential burn chance it offers, but Surf can still be used to give Slowking as much power as possible. Focus Blast is the preferred choice over Fire Blast, as it has better overall coverage, hitting Dark- and most Steel-type Pokemon for super effective damage. However, Focus Blast's shaky accuracy can be off-putting, and Fire Blast allows Slowking to readily take out Grass- and Steel-type Pokemon. Ice Beam can be used in the third moveslot but Slowking gets more use out of Focus Blast and Fire Blast, as they both have better power and coverage, which is essential considering Slowking has a limited number of turns to attack after setting up Trick Room. Psyshock is Slowking's backup STAB option, allowing it to cover even more Pokemon, targeting Florges and Roserade on their weaker defensive stat. If Psyshock's additional coverage is not needed, Nasty Plot can be used to make Slowking much more threatening under Trick Room. Nasty Plot also allows Slowking to become a greater offensive threat against defensive teams that aren't adversely affected by Trick Room.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>With a Quiet nature and a Speed IV of 0, Slowking is as slow as possible, which allows it to outspeed nearly the entire tier under Trick Room. With maximum HP and Special Attack, Slowking gets the bulk it needs to take hits while being able to hit as hard as possible. Regenerator restores Slowking's HP as it switches out, allowing it to set up Trick Room multiple times in a match if needed. Leftovers increases Slowking's longevity by giving it passive recovery and is the recommended item when running Nasty Plot. Life Orb is still usable, as Regenerator offsets the recoil damage it causes when Slowking attacks. Life Orb also allows Slowking to hit as hard as it possibly can, and it is especially favorable if Nasty Plot is not chosen, as if so, Slowking has no other means of boosting its power. If extra bulk is required, a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 SpD with a Sassy nature can be used, with Nasty Plot to compensate for Slowking's lesser offensive presence. Slack Off can also be used to keep Slowking healthy without the need to switch, but this means it loses offensive potential by giving up either Nasty Plot or one of its coverage options.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Because setting Trick Room up is the primary goal of this Slowking set, use the move as soon as the opportunity presents itself; from there, Slowking can go on the offensive, turning the Speed stats of faster Pokemon against them. If Slowking is running Nasty Plot, it's preferred to use it on a weaker move or a predicted switch, followed by setting up Trick Room afterward. This allows Slowking to have as many offensive turns as possible after setting up, making it an immediate threat for the opponent. Never set Nasty Plot up after using Trick Room unless it's absolutely necessary, because this will cost Slowking a vital turn it could be using to attack. Sadly, Slowking's selection of coverage choices will always leave it walled by something, so adjust your team according to what Slowking has trouble breaking through. With Fire Blast and Psyshock, Slowking will be unable to beat Umbreon and Hydreigon. The combination of Focus Blast and Psyshock leaves Slowking walled by Celebi and Chesnaught to a lesser extent, as Chesnaught's Defense allows it to survive a Psyshock if Life Orb is not chosen. With only Scald and Fire Blast, Slowking is walled by all bulky Water-types in the tier except Swampert, as well as Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Noivern, and Mega Ampharos. With only Scald and Focus Blast, Celebi, Roserade, Noivern, and Chesnaught are able to stop Slowking short. Lastly, Jellicent, and Starmie will wall Slowking by virtue of their typing regardless of what moves Slowking chooses to run.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Slowking's use of Trick Room offers great support to Pokemon who can abuse it for themselves, such as Choice Band Snorlax, Reuniclus, Escavalier, Mega Ampharos, Exploud, and Druddigon. Druddigon, Mega Ampharos, and Escavalier also have notable synergy with Slowking, each covering some of its weaknesses. Pokemon that also set Trick Room, such as Aromatisse, Cofagrigus, Porygon2, and Bronzong, are able to support Slowking as well as the rest of their team.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Trick Room", "desc"=>"For 5 turns, all active Pokemon with lower Speed will move before those with higher Speed, within their priority brackets.

Scald and Psyshock are STAB moves, the former being able to spread burns, and the latter hitting Pokemon such as Florges and Roserade harder. Slack Off gives Slowking a reliable way to regain HP without having to switch out.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given EVs maximize Slowking's physical bulk while giving Slowking a high chance to OHKO offensive Roserade with Psyshock. With a Bold nature, Slowking is able to survive most physical hits easily, though not as well as Suicune. In exchange for lesser physical bulk, however, Slowking has an inherently good Special Defense stat that should not be overlooked; this makes it somewhat of a mixed wall to an extent. Regenerator enables Slowking to recover HP as it switches, which is essential as this is a highly defensive set that relies on having as much HP as possible in order to do its job.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set exchanges better physical bulk for the ability to phaze with Dragon Tail. Take advantage of the phazing support it offers by pairing Slowking with entry hazard setters to help rack up damage throughout the opponent's team. You should also use Dragon Tail to oust Pokemon trying to set up on Slowking, such as Reuniclus and Suicune. As this set takes physical hits better than any of Slowking's other sets, it allows Slowking to more effectively check physical attackers such as Darmanitan, Cobalion, Victini, Crobat, Toxicroak, and Mienshao. Despite Slowking's inherently good Special Defense stat, this set's ability to survive special attacks is poor compared to the Assault Vest set, so try not to let Slowking take them unless it is either absolutely necessary to do so, or they are resisted hits. As Slack Off allows Slowking to recover HP without switching out, take use it to wear down opposing Pokemon passively through recoil or status when applicable.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon such as Cobalion, Mega Aggron, Mega Ampharos, and Chesnaught partner well with physically defensive Slowking, as they can easily switch into Knock Off for it. Chesnaught is a noteworthy partner, as a core of Chesnaught and Slowking can stand up to the majority of the physical attackers in the tier. Slowking's ability to stand up to physical attackers allows it to form a defensive core with Pokemon that can take special attacks, such as Umbreon and Florges. Entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon, Mega Aggron, Forretress, Chesnaught, and Roserade can stack entry hazards to make phazing with Dragon Tail more damaging to the opponent's team. These Pokemon also appreciate Slowking's ability to handle Fire-type moves such as V-create and Flare Blitz from Victini and Darmanitan.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Dragon Tail", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent target.

It also hits Pokemon that Slowking checks such as Emboar and Moltres for super effective damage. In the second slot, Psyshock is Slowking's secondary STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Roselia, which resist its other STAB moves, pretty hard. Fire Blast rounds off Slowking's coverage and usually OHKOes Escavalier and Doublade after Stealth Rock and does heavy damage to Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangrowth that are not weak to Psyshock. Dragon Tail is the primary option for the last slot as it is useful to phaze Calm Mind Delphox and Reuniclus before they become too much of a threat to your team, though Grass Knot can be used to hit Water-type Pokemon harder than Slowking's other moves.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>248 HP EVs give Slowking a Stealth Rock number and decent all-around bulk thanks to Assault Vest and max Special Attack along with a Modest nature, which is used to let Slowking hit decently hard and take advantage of its great coverage. The leftover EVs are placed in Special Defense to amplify the Assault Vest boost.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>You should use Regenerator and Slowking's resistances to keep it healthy and let it act as an offensive pivot, especially against Choice-locked special attackers. However, remember that this Slowking has no Defense investment, so be careful of Pursuit, Knock Off, and physical attackers that have a neutral STAB move, as they can deal a large amount of damage or outright OHKO Slowking; it should only be used to check Pokemon such as Emboar that can't touch it with their main STAB moves.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This Slowking set is best used in balanced and offensive teams in need of an offensive pivot so Choiced attackers that need something to fall back on when they have to switch out such as Braviary and Delphox are good partners. Entry hazard setters such as Rhyperior for Stealth Rock and Roselia for Spikes have nice synergy with Slowking and are very helpful, as it forces a lot of switches and uses Dragon Tail. On more balanced teams, Aromatisse, which takes Dark- and Bug-type attacks and can get rid of status with Aromatherapy, makes a strong core with Slowking. Drapion and Skuntank are also good partners as they help with Cresselia and Reuniclus which can set up on Slowking if Cresselia or Reuniclus are the last Pokemon or if Slowking lacks Dragon Tail. Gligar appreciates having its Water and Ice weakness covered and can wall physical threats while providing useful Defog support, as multiple layers of Spikes can nullify Regenerator. Amoonguss resists some of Slowking's weaknesses and can form a Regenerator core that is very hard to take down.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Assault Vest", "desc"=>"Holder's Sp.

Thunder Wave gives Slowking the ability to support the team by lowering the Speed of many common switch-ins, such as Latias and Venusaur. Between Scald and Thunder Wave, Slowking becomes incredibly difficult to switch in to. Psyshock allows Slowking to take on Keldeo and win in almost every situation, even against the rarer Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo. Slowking can also dent CroCune with Psyshock. Calm Mind is another option on this set over Thunder Wave in order to defeat CroCune and Tail Glow Manaphy that lack Energy Ball.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread allows Slowking to survive two Sacred Swords from +2 Keldeo while maximizing its special bulk. Using Leftovers instead of Assault Vest allows Slowking to use support moves such as Thunder Wave and Slack Off.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Be very careful switching this set in, especially when Landorus hasn't revealed if it carries Knock Off or Latios hasn't revealed its item. It is best to pivot Slowking in and then immediately apply offensive pressure through Scald and Thunder Wave. Psyshock cannot be spammed as easily on most occasions and should be reserved for hitting things currently on the field as opposed to threatening switch-ins.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>With Thunder Wave, Slowking allows slower wallbreakers to become devastating sweepers. In particular, Mega Gardevoir and Mega Heracross appreciate the Thunder Wave support on levitating Pokemon and Flying-types which are not affected by Sticky Web. The burn support from Scald is also useful for Gardevoir due to its lower physical bulk.</p>\n<p>On more defensive teams, Gliscor is a fantastic teammate, as it can take advantage of slower Pokemon and hit Electric-types with Toxic. While Slowking can take Ice- and Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Keldeo, Gliscor is able to absorb the Electric-, Bug-, and Grass-type attacks that bother Slowking. Pokemon that can do a great deal of damage to Slowking, such as Scizor, fear Gliscor's speedy Taunt set.

Scald is Slowking's main STAB move, as it has decent power and a burn chance that can help getting chip damage on Slowking's checks and potentially crippling switch-ins. Slowking doesn't get Hydro Pump, but Surf is an acceptable alternative as it has a bit more Base Power than Scald. Fire Blast OHKOes Escavalier after Stealth Rock damage and does a lot of damage to Grass-type Pokemon that usually wall Slowking. Psyshock is used for additional STAB coverage and to OHKO most Fighting-type Pokemon that have lower Defense than Special Defense, although Nasty Plot can be used as it gives Slowking sweeping potential and the ability to overpower walls. Slack Off can be used to reliably set up Trick Room throughout the game. Slowking should use a 248 HP / 76 Def / 184 SpD spread with a Sassy nature to take hits from a variety of Pokemon and be very reliable during the game. However, this spread can lead to a loss of momentum as it can't hit very hard and gives a free switch to a lot of Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Reuniclus who can start setting up or heal your opponent's team.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Minimum Speed IVs and a Quiet nature give Slowking 58 Speed, allowing to outspeed everything in the tier.

Bronzong, Cofagrigus, and Reuniclus are also good setters of Trick Room, but they share weaknesses with Slowking. Choice Band Escavalier and Rhyperior are the fastest Pokemon in the tier with Trick Room up and can decimate most offensive teams while being almost impossible to switch into for balanced ones. Exploud has just enough Speed to work well in Trick Room and can decimate everything with STAB Boomburst. Druddigon can hit really hard with STAB Outrage and has really nice synergy with Slowking.

Thankfully, it has access to Swords Dance which helps to improve its damage output, as well as having support moves like Roost and Will-O-Wisp which allow Fletchinder to stay around longer despite its poor defenses and 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Will-O-Wisp also helps in terms of getting chip damage on some of Fletchinder's checks.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>This is the most viable set for Fletchinder, and it needs all the attacking power it can get, so running 252 EVs in Attack and an Adamant nature is the best choice. With priority Flying-type moves due to Gale Wings, Fletchinder doesn't need to run too much Speed, but 152 Speed allows it to outspeed and burn opponents like Adamant Honchkrow. Whatever EVs are left over should go into HP just to give Fletchinder a bit of bulk. With its only solid STAB move being Acrobatics, Fletchinder is better off running no item so Acrobatics gets 110 Base Power.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Fletchinder isn't something that can sweep on its own. To use this Pokemon effectively you should be eliminating its counters throughout the game and keeping it healthy for the late-game. Despite being frail, it will usually have an opportunity to set up a Swords Dance which will allow it to deal heavy damage to anything that isn't a check. Outside of being a late-game cleaner, Fletchinder can be useful throughout a match by revenge killing fast, weakened Pokemon with a priority Acrobatics.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Only having Will-O-Wisp and Acrobatics to inflict damage, Fletchinder needs quite a bit of help to sweep. Anything that can take out bulky Water-types is greatly appreciated. Such Pokemon include Magneton, Virizion, Celebi, Shaymin, and Cacturne. With a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, Fletchinder likes entry hazard control from Pokemon like Forretress, Empoleon, Crobat, and Mega Blastoise. Any Pokemon that benefits from having Fighting-types eliminated, such as Hydreigon and Scrafty, are great teammates for Fletchinder.</p>\n", "item"=>nil, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Acrobatics", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent or non-adjacent target.

However, Earthquake can be used instead to hit Pokemon like Raikou, Tentacruel, and Specially Defensive or CM variants of Jirachi for more damage. Scald is Gastrodon's other reliable STAB move, as it can cripple a lot of physical attackers, patching up Gastrodon's lackluster physical defense to make it more difficult to KO as an overall mixed wall. Toxic is a great utility move, as it can cripple common switch-ins, such as Jellicent and Swampert, that don't really care about Gastrodon's other moves. Ice Beam hits Dragon-types that it can switch in on with relative ease, such as Flygon, as well as Grass-types like Chesnaught. Recover is necessary, as without it, Gastrodon will not last as long.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs, along with a Bold or Relaxed nature, are to maximize Gastrodon's physical bulk, which is quite medicore when uninvested, and makes Gastrodon a great mixed wall thanks to its high HP stat and good Special Defense stat. A Relaxed nature should be used if running Earthquake, as Gastrodon can afford to run both physical and special attacks due to its horrific Speed. The HP EVs are to maximize Gastrodon's Leftovers recovery. Leftovers gives Gastrodon residual recovery each turn and can make it a pain to deal with, especially when coupled with Recover.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set takes advantage of Gastrodon's great mixed bulk, as even with base 68 Defense, it can still be very annoying for a good portion of physical attackers due to its access to Scald and its massive HP stat. Gastrodon also has the advantage of being able to switch into a very large portion of the Water-types in the tier, and can force some of them out with Scald and/or Toxic.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Fire-types, such as Victini, Darmanitan, and Mega Houndoom, who can force out a large portion of Grass-types are good partners for Gastrodon, and they can also bait Water-type attacks for Gastrodon to receive a Storm Drain boost. As Gastrodon is very susceptible to Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, a cleric can be used to increase its walling capabilities. Pokemon that have good defensive synergy with Gastrodon, such as Crobat, pair well with it. Crobat works especially well because it resists Grass-types, can break through Fighting-types such Scrafty and Mienshao, and can clear entry hazards that Gastrodon hates, mainly Toxic Spikes. Pokemon that can set up on Blissey and Florges, such as Toxicroak and Jirachi, are also great partners for Gastrodon.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Scald", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent target with a 30% chance to burn it.

Earth Power is a special Ground-type STAB move that hits Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Keldeo for good damage. Ice Beam hits Landorus, Dragonite, and Garchomp decently hard. Earthquake serves the same purpose as Earth Power and also derails Calm Mind users. Toxic is ideal for a wall like Gastrodon, as it slowly wears at the opponent's Pokemon. Recover is reliable recovery, and it helps rack up Toxic damage. Counter is an option as Gastrodon takes most physical hits very well, so Counter can nab some surprising KOs.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>252 HP EVs max out Gastrodon's HP, adding to its bulk, while 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature max out its Defense to handle threats such as Keldeo. Storm Drain gives an immunity to Water-type attacks, with a situational boost to Special Attack. Leftovers provides passive recovery. A Relaxed nature should be used if Earthquake is being used.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Gastrodon best functions as a physical wall that stays in to burn physical attackers or stall with Toxic to cripple opponents. Recover is best used to rack up Toxic damage on the opposing Pokemon. Gastrodon can switch into a predicted Water-type attack and get a free Special Attack boost, which guarantees Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp and Landorus. Gastrodon can also take hits from most physical attackers, so stay in on a physical attack and either attempt to burn the physical attacker with Scald or cripple it with Toxic.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>With Sludge Bomb, Mega Venusaur can counter opposing Grass-types, such as Breloom, which threaten Gastrodon. Ferrothorn can also perform this role, and makes up for not being able to counter Breloom with being able to set up entry hazards. Heatran counters most special attackers that can break through Gastrodon, and Gastrodon can take any Water-type move directed at Heatran. Chansey works well with Gastrodon, as it takes special hits with ease. Skarmory has good defensive synergy with Gastrodon, as Gastrodon takes both Electric- and Fire-type attacks for Skarmory, while Skarmory takes Grass-type attacks directed at Gastrodon, as well as being able to set up hazards.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Scald", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent target with a 30% chance to burn it.

The chance of burn is also very nice, considering the amount of physical attackers that switch in on Gastrodon. Scald can also defrost Gastrodon if it gets frozen by Kyogre's Ice Beam, which would otherwise render it helpless. Toxic is great for annoying and hindering Pokemon that try to come in or set up on Gastrodon; it is also especially good at crippling and pressuring Calm Mind Arceus variants that aren't carrying Refresh. Clear Smog is used to deal with Calm Mind Kyogre sets and other setup sweepers. Mirror Coat can be used as an alternative to Clear Smog as it bounces back huge amounts of damage to most special attackers that hardly inflict any damage to Gastrodon, such as Kyogre, Palkia, and some Calm Mind Arceus formes. Recover is Gastrodon's most reliable recovery move and can be used on the turn Kyogre switches out to maximize your chances of walling special attackers. Most of these moves punish the opponent for using Kyogre recklessly and will help with crippling and punching a hole in the opposing team.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum HP EVs should always be used to take advantage of Gastrodon's large bulk and maximize the amount of damage it can take. 120 Defense EVs allow Gastrodon to avoid the 2HKO from support Groudon and Low Kick Blaziken as well as the OHKO from +2 Life Orb Jolly Extreme Speed Arceus. 136 Special Defense EVs still allow Gastrodon to check Choice Specs Ice Beam Kyogre and wall other special attackers. A Calm nature is used to further increase Gastrodon's Special Defense. Storm Drain is the obvious choice of ability, as it provides a Water-type immunity and raises Gastrodon's Special Attack by one stage if hit by a Water-type attack. An EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD can also be used, as it allows Gastrodon to take even less damage from special attacks and maximizes its walling capacity, although this also renders it highly prone to Mega Mewtwo Y's Psystrike and physical attacks.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Switch in on Kyogre's attacks if you don't want serious damage done to your team. Gastrodon is extremely predictable, so change your switch-ins to Water-type attacks to keep your opponent from predicting you and outplaying you. Gastrodon is a Pokemon that absolutely hates hazards, especially Toxic Spikes. Try to keep hazards off your side of the field as much as you can to prevent Gastrodon from being worn down. Scout for any Grass-type moves you think the opponent might have, as Grass-type attacks are Gastrodon's only weakness.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Cleric support is highly appreciated by Gastrodon, as status can severely hinder its walling ability. Xerneas is a good cleric that works well with Gastrodon. Fire- or Flying-type Pokemon such as Ho-Oh are good teammates, as they cover Gastrodon's Grass-type weakness. Defoggers are also highly appreciated, as they remove entry hazards so Gastrodon can switch into Water- and Electric-type attacks freely without cost. Giratina formes are very good partners, as Giratina can wall physical attackers that Gastrodon doesn't like.

After one boost, Moltres's Speed is propelled to an insane 506, which allows it to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf base 105 Speed Pokemon. Flamethrower is used over Fire Blast because this set is mainly for mid- or late-game sweeping, which means Moltres can't afford to miss. Also, around that time in the game, most of the opponent's Pokemon would be weakened, so Flamethrower would clean up nicely. However, if you prefer the extra power, Fire Blast can be used over Flamethrower. Hurricane is Moltres's other insanely strong STAB attack that rounds out Moltres's near-perfect coverage. Roost is used to recover HP lost from resisted hits, Life Orb recoil, and Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Grass is a viable option over Roost, which allows Moltres to pick off weakened Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum Special Attack, a Modest nature, and a Life Orb ensure Moltres hits as hard as possible. This moveset only recommends 148 Speed EVs because that's all the investment that's necessary for Moltres to outspeed the entire tier after using Agility. The rest of the EV investment was placed into HP for a little bulk. You can always use a 252 SpA / 4 Def / 252 Spe spread if you want Moltres to outspeed Pokemon like Hitmonlee and non-Choice Scarf Rotom-C. Be wary of Rock- and bulky Water-type Pokemon like Slowking and Lanturn because they can wall this set. There's no need to ever run a positive Speed nature since you'll be increasing your Speed with Agility. The extra Speed may be nice but the drop off in power is noticeable.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This moveset functions just like the all-out attacking Life Orb moveset. The goal is to blast the opposing Pokemon with Moltres's extremely powerful STAB attacks after boosting Moltres's Speed with Agility. This moveset is best when used mid- or late-game, or after most of Moltres's checks and counters have been eliminated. For example, you would switch Moltres in on a resisted Grass-type attack from a Pokemon Moltres forces out, then boost its Speed with Agility as your opponent switches. It's also possible to masquerade as the conventional Life Orb wall breaking set in order to lure your opponent into a false sense of security. Your opponent is guaranteed to be stumped by this tactic, as their checks would be overwhelmed when matched against Moltres's insane Speed after using Agility.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Support from Substitute + Baton Pass Jolteon can prove to be very useful. With Substitute Moltres is able to avoid status moves and attacks, and set up Agility safely. Both Pokemon share decent synergy as Jolteon only has one weakness, which is to Ground. Moltres is a Flying-type Pokemon and is immune to the Ground-type moves aimed at Jolteon, so thanks to its typing, there's a higher probability Moltres will be passed a Substitute. Rotom-C is a great partner as well as it resists every one of Moltres's weaknesses. It's also able to remove some of Moltres's counters with its Grass- and Electric-type STAB attacks. It can also avoid Ice- and Fire-type attacks through the use of Volt Switch, which is a very effective way to switch Moltres in safely since Moltres can take Ice- and Fire-type attacks well. Moltres always needs a Pokemon that can rid the field of entry hazards. Hitmonlee and Shiftry are amazing offensive hazard removers that can eliminate Moltres's checks and counters and remove Stealth Rock at the same time. Hitmonlee's High Jump Kick is insanely strong and even 2HKOes Pokemon that resist Fighting-type attacks. Shiftry's ability to force out bulky Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon with its Grass-type STAB attacks and its overpowered Knock Offs is unmatched.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Roost", "desc"=>"The user restores 1/2 of its maximum HP, rounded half up.

Hurricane is its second STAB move that is only resisted by Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-type Pokemon. Flamethrower is a much more reliable STAB which can be used on weakened Pokemon or for a late-game sweep if you can't afford to miss. U-turn is used in order to scout and keep or gain momentum. Roost is also an option but when your opponent realizes you're Choice-locked into it, Moltres becomes setup bait. Tailwind can be a last ditch move that allows Moltres to support its teammates after being KOed.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A Choice Scarf mitigates Moltres's awkward Speed and allows it to beat its normal checks along with its Choice Scarf checks and counters such as Jolteon, Heliosk, Rotom-C, and Cobalion. A Modest nature is preferred over a Timid nature for some extra power, although a Timid nature allows Moltres to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom-C. U-turn is just a filler move and is used to gain momentum. As it won't be OHKOing anything, nothing wrong with a nature that lowers its Attack.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Choice Scarf Moltres can be used as an effective lead Pokemon. Choice Scarf Moltres also holds a bit of surprise factor because most people would assume it's a Life Orb or defensive variant. Its Choice Scarf allows it to get rid of its normal checks and counters, such as Jolteon, Cobalion with Stone Edge, Heliolisk, Virizion with Stone Edge, and Choice Scarf Rotom-C.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Moltres needs Rapid Spin support for every set it runs because of its severe weakness to Stealth Rock. Defog support is equally as effective as Rapid Spin is but at the cost of your own entry hazards. Hitmonlee is RU's best offensive spinner and does a great job of removing this set's counters.

Druddigon is a good teammate because it can eat the Water- and Electric-type moves that Moltres can't handle. Cobalion is also a great option that offers great hazard support with Stealth Rock and provides a nice Rock-type resist. Spikes-stacking Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Roselia, and Accelgor are also excellent partners for Moltres. Accelgor and Qwilfish should be utilized on offensive teams as suicide lead support Pokemon.

Fire Blast is Moltres's most useful STAB move, as it's capable of hitting a majority of the tier for large amounts of damage. Hurricane is Moltres's secondary STAB move that hits most things for great damage and covers most of the Pokemon that resist Fire Blast. Hidden Power Grass rounds out Moltres's coverage, and allows Moltres to hit Ground-, Water-, and Rock-types for super effective damage. Roost is handy, enabling Moltres to recover from Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage as well as resisted hits, increasing its longevity.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A Timid nature and maximum EV investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures that Moltres will hit as hard and fast as possible. It's also possible to give Moltres a Modest nature but it won't be able to outspeed Pokemon such as Rotom-C that it would normally. Life Orb adds to Moltres's exceptional power and is useful for ensuring Fire Blast and Hurricane attain crucial KOs. The 4 EVs in Defense instead of in HP will allow Moltres to switch into Stealth Rock twice without being KOed.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Because of Moltres's Fire / Flying typing, it loses 50% of its health every time it switches into Stealth Rock, which means Moltres should always be paired with a Pokemon who can remove entry hazards. Moltres also needs a teammate that can set hazards up as they are crucial to secure numerous OHKOs and 2HKOs. For example, after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, Assault Vest Slowking is 2HKOed by Hurricane.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Moltres needs a teammate that can clear the field of hazards because Stealth Rock cuts its health in half every time it switches in. Hitmonlee is RU's best offensive spinner because of its incredibly strong STAB move High Jump Kick, which allows Hitmonlee to eliminate hazard setters like Rhyperior and Druddigon. Shiftry is another Pokemon that shares great synergy with Moltres because of its ability to clear the field of all hazards with Defog, and at the same time, challenge Moltres's biggest counters, which are the tier's bulky Water-type Pokemon. Giving Moltres hazard support is just as important as pairing it with a teammate who can remove hazards. Druddigon is one of the best Pokemon to consider for a hazard supporting role, as with its great bulk and Dragon-typing, it's able to absorb Water- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Moltres. Druddigon is no sitting duck; it has a huge base 120 Attack and a plethora of moves that can take advantage of its sky-high Attack. Zoroark is another great option because of its ability to challenge Moltres's counters with its powerful attacks such as Knock Off, Grass Knot, Flamethrower, and Sucker Punch. Grass Knot allows it to beat Rock-, Water-, and Ground-type switch-ins and Knock Off devastates everything else. It's also able to masquerade as Moltres thanks to its ability, Illusion, and can confuse the opponent longer through the use of Flamethrower. Also, a Pokemon that can spread paralysis can also be very useful and it would make it possible for Moltres to beat Pokemon such as Cobalion, Virizion, and Delphox that outspeed it.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Life Orb", "desc"=>"Holder's damaging moves do 1.3x damage; loses 1/10 max HP after the attack.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"life orb"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Fire Blast", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent target with a 10% chance to burn it.", "type"=>"Fire", "category"=>"Special"}, {"name"=>"Hurricane", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent or non-adjacent target with a 30% chance to confuse it.

Flamethrower is used so Moltres is not completely shut down by Taunt or Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon who are immune to Toxic. Roost is a very important part of this set because it allows Moltres to recover HP lost from passive damage and resisted hits.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Pressure is an amazing ability, especially for a set like this one. With Pressure, Moltres is able to limit the amount of PP a Pokemon has, which can prove to be very useful when used with Roost and Substitute. This moveset is difficult for bulky offensive and balanced teams to break through without losing a lot of PP or being crippled by Toxic. Leftovers are essential because they provide Moltres with much needed passive recovery. This moveset is geared to take advantage of Pressure and Moltres's great resistances, in order to Toxic stall the opponent. Moltres is given a Timid nature and 136 Speed EVs in order to outspeed everything up to Adamant Hitmonlee. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Defense to give Moltres as much bulk as possible. The 124 Defense EVs can easily be moved to Special Defense to handle an uninvested Scald from Lanturn or Slowking.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Defensive SubRoost Moltres is best if used on a balanced, stall, or semi-stall team. Moltres is fast for a defensive Pokemon so it'll have the advantage against most of the tier's other defensive Pokemon. This is essential for this set because it's built to take advantage of Moltres's ability to PP stall with Pressure and wear down the opponent with Toxic. Moltres can switch in on many common defensive Pokemon such as Aromatisse, Amoonguss, Bronzong, Gligar, and Registeel, and then proceed to Toxic stall the aforementioned Pokemon and more into submission.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Like every Moltres moveset, this one needs a bulky Pokemon who can remove hazards. Hitmontop is a great defensive hazard remover. Hitmontop has great Defense and its ability, Intimidate, helps it when dealing with top-tier physical threats. Intimidate can also make it easier for Moltres to deal with physical threats. Hitmontop's Special Defense is also very high, so it's able to take Electric- and Water-type attacks aimed at Moltres. A powerful Ground-type Pokemon who can set up hazards would also be appreciated because it's able to get rid of Poison-type Pokemon who are immune to Toxic. Dragalge can also be a great supporting teammate because it can take the Water- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Moltres, as well as spread poison around with Toxic Spikes, thus making it easier for Moltres to Pressure stall the opponent. Drapion is also a great option for a defensive Toxic Spikes stacking Pokemon. A Pokemon with the ability to phaze opposing Pokemon is useful too, along with a Toxic Spikes stacking Pokemon and Moltres.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Substitute", "desc"=>"The user takes 1/4 of its maximum HP, rounded down, and puts it into a substitute to take its place in battle.

Substitute provides protection from status, which otherwise cripples Moltres, and is easy to set up thanks to Moltres's handy resistances. Any defensive Pokemon worth its salt loves a form of recovery; Roost provides this longevity for Moltres. Toxic is a great way to cripple common switch-ins, especially bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Azumarill. Finally, Flamethrower is a decently strong STAB attack that has the added advantage of denting many Pokemon that don't mind Toxic, such as Steel-types, Mega Venusaur, Poison Heal Gliscor, and Celebi.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given EVs and Calm nature emphasize special bulk, allowing Moltres to check the likes of Alakazam, Landorus, and Mega Charizard Y, while also minimizing Stealth Rock damage and allowing Moltres to outspeed Adamant variants of Bisharp and Breloom. Leftovers is the item of choice for its useful HP restoration.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set is designed to stall out opposing Pokemon with passive damage from Toxic while keeping healthy with Roost. Moltres should try to set up a Substitute on Pokemon that cannot break it, such as Gliscor, or when it is expected that the opponent will switch out. A good example of when to use Substitute is if Moltres is on the field against a Ferrothorn. Keep in mind that if Moltres is not safely behind a Substitute, Toxic should nearly always be used to hit Water-types as they switch in, which will force Moltres out otherwise. It is also important to remember that Pressure will double the PP cost of moves used against Moltres, so it is feasible to stall out the PP of moves such as Stone Edge or Hydro Pump through the use of Substitute and Roost. Because Stealth Rock takes a huge 50% of Moltres's HP upon switching in, you should play cautiously when it is on the field, as using Substitute once before switching out will make Moltres only useful as death fodder unless you've previously removed Stealth Rock. Although this set invests in Special Defense, Moltres's typing allows it to check physical attackers, too. Scizor and Conkeldurr can do very little outside of Knock Off, and Ground-types such as Excadrill that lack a Rock-type coverage move will be completely shut down.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This Moltres set is best suited for defensively inclined or balanced teams. In order for it to be effective, Defog or Rapid Spin support is a necessity; Excadrill has nice defensive synergy with Moltres and can demolish Tyranitar and Heatran with its STAB Earthquake. Mega Blastoise coves Moltres's Water-type vulnerability and Moltres can comfortably switch into Grass-type attacks aimed at Mega Blastoise. As far as Defog users go, Latios is an excellent choice, particularly variants carrying Earthquake, as they effectively lure and remove Heatran and deal nice damage to Tyranitar. Defensive, bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Gourgeist-XL are great partners as they can switch into Electric- and Water-type moves. In return, Moltres can check Fire-type threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Teammates that can handle fast physical attackers such as Terrakion, Garchomp, and Talonflame are wise choices; Landorus-T and Rotom-W are effective in this pivot role and can often bring Moltres in safely with U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively. Landorus-T can also set up Stealth Rock to wear down opposing Pokemon.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Substitute", "desc"=>"The user takes 1/4 of its maximum HP, rounded down, and puts it into a substitute to take its place in battle.

Solar Beam's synergy with Sunny Day is self-explanatory, and it lets Moltres bypass some of its most common checks too, OHKOing Rhyperior and 2HKOing Assault Vest Slowking, Regirock, and Lanturn. Morning Sun heals an astounding 66% of Moltres' HP whenever sun is in effect, allowing Moltres to heal off Life Orb recoil and use Pressure in order to stall out the Water-type moves weakened by the sun. Roost is an option over Morning Sun, since the latter's low PP might be undesired, especially when games drag on for longer. However, Roost's higher PP and secondary effect of removing Moltres's Flying typing temporarily are usually unneeded making it an inferior option overall.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The chosen EV spread is standard on offensive Pokemon, with a Timid nature to make use of Moltres's respectable Speed tier. The Special Attack investment coupled with a Life Orb gives Moltres all of the firepower it needs to fulfill its role properly.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Moltres set functions best as a lure and wallbreaker, using its high-powered Fire Blast, Solar Beam's coverage, and Morning Sun's recovery in order to plow through entire slower teams. Despite having Sunny Day in its moves, Moltres is meant to be used as a standalone sweeper, and not as a dedicated supporter for Chlorophyll sweepers, similarly to how sets such as Trick Room Reuniclus and even Rain Dance Ludicolo work. Moltres is a little less useful against faster teams, but it can still make use of its decent defensive typing in order to find switch-in opportunities and proceed to punch holes through the enemy team. Even if Moltres doesn't have the opportunity to set up Sunny Day, it can still function outside of sun.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>As with any Moltres variant, entry hazard removal through either Defog or Rapid Spin is a must for its effectiveness. Skuntank, Gligar, and Kabutops are usually fit for that job. Due to its prowess as a wallbreaker, Moltres also benefits from entry hazards of its own; the likes of Cobalion and Qwilfish can easily set these up, while also possessing good synergy with Moltres. As for offensive partners, Pokemon that benefit from Moltres's ability to lure Rock-types, such as Cinccino and Delphox, as well as Chlorophyll sweepers that benefit from both the sun and the holes Moltres punches, such as Shiftry and Victreebel, are all good teammates. As for more defensively-oriented options, Pokemon that can check the Fire-types that might abuse Moltres's own sun, such as Regirock and other Rock-types, are fine options. Water-types can be used too, but it's not recommended, since the sun weakens their STAB moves. Lastly, Cresselia is an outstanding option with this Moltres set, due to their amazing synergy. Moltres's Sunny Day boosts Cresselia's Moonlight, while Cresselia provides Moltres with Thunder Wave and Lunar Dance support.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Life Orb", "desc"=>"Holder's damaging moves do 1.3x damage; loses 1/10 max HP after the attack.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"life orb"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Sunny Day", "desc"=>"For 5 turns, the weather becomes Sunny Day.

With the given EV spread, Slowking can absorb any of Landorus's attacks and have more than a 50% chance to KO it with Scald. Fire Blast allows Slowking take down Ferrothorn and Skarmory with relative ease and always KO Bisharp that lack investment in bulk. Future Sight is an excellent option combined with a Pokemon such as Azumarill that lures in Mega Venusaur or Bisharp that lures in Keldeo to put them in a checkmate position, as they cannot effectively check those Pokemon due to the threat of Future Sight. Dragon Tail, meanwhile, stops special setup sweepers such as Manaphy. The EV spread and Assault Vest allow Slowking to survive a +6 Energy Ball from Manaphy and force it out. Psychic is the best way to hit Mega Venusaur, which is commonly physically defensive, and allows Slowking to easily take down Keldeo. Power Gem allows Slowking to KO Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame in almost any situation. Thundurus is hit hard by Power Gem as well and never survives two hits. Alternatively, Ice Beam is a very solid way to deal with the Dragons in OU and hits Gliscor and Landorus harder than Scald.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>With the EV spread presented, Slowking avoids a 2HKO from Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam. The Special Attack investment allows Power Gem to knock out Talonflame and Charizard Y while also knocking out Bisharp with Fire Blast. A Modest nature increases Slowking's power, allowing it to fire back hard; a Quiet nature should be used if Dragon Tail is run in order to retain maximum damage. As Slowking is rather slow to begin with, the little bit of Speed that is lost is negligible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Slowking's bulk allows it to pivot into and threaten just about any special attacker. Its special bulk and good movepool allow it to be a very useful defensive pivot, applying pressure to the majority of the opponent's team. It can also scout most special attackers due to this major special bulk and regain a lot of health with Regenerator by pivoting in and out as a scout. However, when playing against Mega Charizard Y, it is advised that you be wary of using Slowking as a check, as Solar Beam can still take a great deal of its health. Pivot switches to get Slowking into a Fire Blast may be useful. Watch out for Knock Off on Landorus, too.</p>\n<p>Slowking does have the ability to take on some mixed attackers, but leaving Slowking in on most physical attacks is unwise. Bisharp is an especially large nuisance, as it is able to OHKO Slowking with Knock Off or trap it with Pursuit.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Slowking appreciates Pokemon that can cover its Electric-, Bug-, and Dark-type weaknesses, so Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, which can absorb these attacks with relative ease, make for great teammates. Chesnaught has near-perfect type synergy with Slowking, as it resists Dark and Electric and is immune to Shadow Ball thanks to Bulletproof. Chesnaught's physical bulk coupled with Slowking's special bulk makes them even more compatible. Conkeldurr resists Dark-type attacks and is bulky enough to take many physical hits that would bother Slowking. Due to Slowking's Psychic resistance and special bulk, the benefits are mutual. Lastly, Slowking synergizes well with cleric Fairy-types due to its Steel resistance and their resistances to Bug and Dark. Furthermore, Slowking can only heal by switching and cannot get rid of status, so cleric support from Clefable or Sylveon is much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Partners to take advantage of Future Sight are vital to utilizing it effectively. Some examples of Pokemon that don't enjoy taking a Future Sight include Mega Venusaur, Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Landorus-T, so Pokemon such as Azumarill, Keldeo, Bisharp, and Garchomp that can lure some of these Pokemon in make for effective partners. Bisharp is an especially effective partner because it threatens Chansey and can break through common foes like Gliscor, Skarmory, and Quagsire with the aid of Future Sight.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Assault Vest", "desc"=>"Holder's Sp.

A Modest nature increases Slowking's power, allowing it to fire back hard; a Quiet nature should be used if Dragon Tail is run in order to retain maximum damage. As Slowking is rather slow to begin with, the little bit of Speed that is lost is negligible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Slowking's bulk allows it to pivot into and threaten just about any special attacker. Its special bulk and good movepool allow it to be a very useful defensive pivot, applying pressure to the majority of the opponent's team. It can also scout most special attackers due to this major special bulk and regain a lot of health with Regenerator by pivoting in and out as a scout. However, when playing against Mega Charizard Y, it is advised that you be wary of using Slowking as a check, as Solar Beam can still take a great deal of its health. Pivot switches to get Slowking into a Fire Blast may be useful. Watch out for Knock Off on Landorus, too.</p>\n<p>Slowking does have the ability to take on some mixed attackers, but leaving Slowking in on most physical attacks is unwise. Bisharp is an especially large nuisance, as it is able to OHKO Slowking with Knock Off or trap it with Pursuit.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Slowking appreciates Pokemon that can cover its Electric-, Bug-, and Dark-type weaknesses, so Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, which can absorb these attacks with relative ease, make for great teammates. Chesnaught has near-perfect type synergy with Slowking, as it resists Dark and Electric and is immune to Shadow Ball thanks to Bulletproof. Chesnaught's physical bulk coupled with Slowking's special bulk makes them even more compatible. Conkeldurr resists Dark-type attacks and is bulky enough to take many physical hits that would bother Slowking. Due to Slowking's Psychic resistance and special bulk, the benefits are mutual. Lastly, Slowking synergizes well with cleric Fairy-types due to its Steel resistance and their resistances to Bug and Dark. Furthermore, Slowking can only heal by switching and cannot get rid of status, so cleric support from Clefable or Sylveon is much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Partners to take advantage of Future Sight are vital to utilizing it effectively. Some examples of Pokemon that don't enjoy taking a Future Sight include Mega Venusaur, Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Landorus-T, so Pokemon such as Azumarill, Keldeo, Bisharp, and Garchomp that can lure some of these Pokemon in make for effective partners. Bisharp is an especially effective partner because it threatens Chansey and can break through common foes like Gliscor, Skarmory, and Quagsire with the aid of Future Sight.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Assault Vest", "desc"=>"Holder's Sp.

Psyshock is Slowking's other STAB move, hitting specially defensive Pokemon such as Roserade and Florges on their weaker Defense stat. Dragon Tail is one of the big selling points of Slowking, as it can phaze Pokemon, hindering setup sweepers as well as possibly inflicting further damage with entry hazards. Ice Beam and Fire Blast are both able to hit the Grass-types that Slowking tends to attract. Ice Beam is generally more useful, as it is able to hit Hydreigon and other Dragon-types super effectively. Fire Blast, however, deals much more damage to Steel-types, such as Forretress, Cobalion, and Escavalier.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Assault Vest boosts Slowking's excellent Special Defense to even greater heights, letting Slowking sponge a multitude of special attacks, even most of the ones it's weak to. Regenerator makes Slowking incredibly hard to wear down, restoring 33% of its HP upon switching out. The given EV spread maximizes Slowking's HP while giving it as much of an offensive presence as possible with the leftover EVs placed into Special Defense, as even without investment, Slowking's Special Defense is staggeringly high with Assault Vest equipped. However, if Slowking needs to take special attacks more easily, an alternate spread of 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 SpD can be used to maximize Special Defense while allowing Slowking to OHKO offensive Roserade with Psyshock. A Quiet nature with 12 Attack EVs can be used so that Dragon Tail is able to reliably break Kingdra's Substitutes. Focus Blast can be used in the fourth moveslot to hit Dark- and Steel-types switching in, but be wary of its shaky accuracy. Grass Knot can also be used if your team requires support against bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Mega Blastoise, though it isn't useful for much else.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Slowking set functions as an offensive pivot that doubles as a special tank, so it's best used when switching in on special attackers it's effectively able to check, sponging a hit, and responding with the appropriate coverage move. Pokemon such as Noivern, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Starmie, and Porygon-Z are effectively checked by this set. Because of its ability Regenerator, switching in and out with Slowking is actually encouraged as it replenishes HP, offsetting damage taken from entry hazards, weaker or resisted attacks, and status. Thanks to Dragon Tail, Slowking is able to check most Calm Mind users in the tier and force them out. This allows it to keep them at bay, repeatedly deterring setup throughout the early- and mid-game phases. Assault Vest Slowking can even survive special attacks it's weak to in a pinch, including STAB moves from Chandelure, Roserade, Hydreigon, Rotom-H, Mega Houndoom, and Raikou, though it's not advised to let Slowking take these attacks unless Slowking is able to take out the attacker immediately afterward. For the most part, it's best to have a backup special wall to handle the aforementioned special attackers, which Slowking prefers not to deal with.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Because this set is more of an offensive pivot that doubles as a special tank, backing from a specially defensive Pokemon that can handle special moves it normally doesn't want to take is helpful. Umbreon and Florges are both valuable, as they both cover some of Slowking's weaknesses. Florges is especially notable, as it can sponge Dark- and Bug-type moves for Slowking, while Slowking can check Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Chandelure for Florges. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, defensive Mega Ampharos, and Arcanine can form a defensive core with Slowking to cover physical and special attacks, taking the physical moves that Slowking otherwise falls victim to. These Pokemon are also notable for their ability to take Knock Off, a move that Slowking fares poorly against. Slowking has issues breaking through Florges, even with Psyshock, and Florges can't be forced out due to its immunity to Dragon Tail; partners who can take out Florges for Slowking, such as Crobat, Nidoking, Darmanitan, and Cobalion, are much appreciated. Because Slowking is able to phaze the opponent's Pokemon with Dragon Tail, entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish, Roserade, Chesnaught, Forretress, Donphan, and Mega Aggron are suitable partners, as the support they offer helps wear down the opposing team. Other Pokemon with Regenerator, such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Mienshao, can form an annoying Regenerator core that outlasts the opponent's Pokemon through constant switching.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Assault Vest", "desc"=>"Holder's Sp.

Psyshock is a reliable secondary STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Roselia resist Slowking's other STAB move while helping in winning Calm Mind wars. However, Fire Blast can be used for a stronger hit on Escavalier and Grass-type switch-ins. Calm Mind gives Slowking sweeping potential, giving it much-needed power and making it nearly unbreakable on the special side. Slack Off gives Slowking reliable recovery and keeps Slowking healthy while it sets up.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>248 HP EVs give Slowking a Stealth Rock number that minimizes the residual damage it takes. Max Defense investment with a Bold nature is used to take physical attacks well while setting up with Calm Mind. Leftovers is the item of choice, letting Slowking heal some damage without having to use Slack Off too frequently.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Slowking can still take most special hits decently thanks to its natural bulk and can shrug them off with Calm Mind, so you can use it early- or mid-game as a pivot because Regenerator will keep it healthy. You should set up late-game when Dark-type Pokemon and strong physical attackers are gone, as they can easily overpower Slowking while it sets up. This set also hates Toxic, so you should be careful against Alomomola and Bronzong, which commonly use the move.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This Slowking works well as a win condition in stall teams but it is a nice fit on balanced teams too thanks to its good mixed bulk and ability to form defensive cores with a lot of Pokemon. Physically defensive Aromatisse can take Dark- and Bug-type attacks well and cure Slowking from Toxic with Aromatherapy. Other physical walls such as Gligar are also useful to take on the physical attackers that threaten Slowking, namely Hitmonlee, Drapion, Skuntank, and Doublade. Toxic Spikes support is incredibly useful for Slowking to outlast other Calm Mind sweepers and walls. Roselia and Drapion are good users of the move and can also absorb Toxic Spikes on entry.

Psyshock is necessary to hit Pokemon such as Florges and Roserade on their weaker physical Defense stat. Ice Beam and Fire Blast both hit the Grass-types that check Slowking; Ice Beam also nails Hydreigon and other Dragon-types, while Fire Blast immediately dispatches Steel-types such as Forretress, Cobalion and Escavalier. Trick is preferred for the last moveslot, as crippling special walls such as Florges, Umbreon, and Snorlax can prove to be invaluable in helping Slowking or its teammates, though Focus Blast allows Slowking to deal serious damage to Dark-types switching in. Grass Knot can also be used in the fourth moveslot if your team requires more support against bulky Water-type Pokemon; with Choice Specs, it's capable of nabbing a 2HKO on Mega Blastoise, Jellicent, Suicune, and Swampert.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>With a Modest nature and Choice Specs, Slowking reaches the full potential of its strength. Regenerator is Slowking's best ability, giving it access to reliable recovery while dealing damage throughout a match. The EVs listed give Slowking as much bulk and power as possible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Be advised that this set is significantly less bulky than the Assault Vest set, so Slowking's ability to switch in and out on attacks is reduced. With Regenerator, Slowking differentiates itself from other Choice item users, as they get worn down as they switch in and out repeatedly to change attacks, while Slowking receives 33% of its HP back when it switches out. This greatly eases the punishment associated with predicting incorrectly, though bear in mind that this doesn't grant Slowking absolute freedom to use any move; Slowking, like any other Choice item user, still relies heavily on using the correct move to put pressure on the opponent. On top of this, Slowking is slow, meaning it also depends on either hitting a Pokemon switching in or taking a blow and retaliating. Due to the surprise value of Trick, it's best to use the move after revealing to the opponent that Slowking is holding Choice Specs, as special walls like Umbreon and Florges will be much more likely to switch in on Slowking in the hopes of forcing it out and getting free turns.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Choice Specs Slowking's hit-and-run nature lends it to being switched in and out numerous times, so partners that can cover its weaknesses allow it to constantly switch in much more easily. Grass-types such as Roserade, Shaymin, and Amoonguss can take the Grass- and Electric-type moves aimed at Slowking. Dark-types such as Hydreigon, Umbreon, and Mega Houndoom can switch in on the Dark- and Ghost-type moves directed at Slowking; the former two also check most Electric-type attackers while all three can check most Grass-types. Pokemon that can take the Bug- and Grass-type moves aimed at Slowking such as Chandelure, Arcanine, and Crobat are appreciated, as are Ground-types like Hippowdon, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Swampert, which can absorb the Electric-type moves that Slowking is weak to. In return, Slowking can check most of the bulky Water-type Pokemon that give these Pokemon trouble, especially if it opts to run Grass Knot.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Choice Specs", "desc"=>"Holder's Sp.

Thunder Wave cripples fast attackers on the switch and Toxic helps with bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Alomomola, but most switch-ins are crippled more by the paralysis from Thunder Wave and the burn from Scald, so it is usually inferior. Slack Off gives Slowking reliable recovery and keeps Slowking healthy when it can't afford to switch out. It also helps to stall if you are running Toxic. Dragon Tail is useful to beat most Calm Mind sweepers such as Reuniclus.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>248 HP EVs give Slowking a Stealth Rock number that minimizes residual damage. 184 EVs in Special Defense let Slowking avoid the 2HKO from Timid Life Orb Moltres's Hurricane.

Abuse Regenerator to keep Slowking healthy and spread status without being worn down. Scald is usually the best move to go for on predicted switches as neither of Slowking's checks, such as Drapion or Skuntank, appreciate a burn too much. This Slowking can take some physical hits thanks to its investment in Defense, but strong physical attacks will leave a big dent in Slowking, so switching out in front of strong physical attackers is usually the best option.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Aromatisse, which takes Dark- and Bug-type attacks and can get rid of status with Aromatherapy, is a very good partner and makes a strong core with Slowking. Registeel can set up Stealth Rock and walls most special attackers Slowking can't deal with very well such as Exploud while appreciating Slowking's ability to wall Fire-types. Weezing can set up Toxic Spikes, freeing a slot for an additional attack or Dragon Tail, and takes most of the physical hits that trouble Slowking really well thanks to its stellar physical bulk. Drapion can set up Toxic Spikes too and can help with Psychic-type Pokemon such as Cresselia and Reuniclus, as it can phaze them if they try to set up on Slowking or hit them hard with STAB Knock Off. Gligar and Golbat, which appreciate having some of their weaknesses covered and can wall physical threats, are also good partners and the Defog support they provide is also useful as multiple layers of Spikes can nullify Regenerator. Finally, Amoonguss and Roselia resist Slowking's Electric and Grass weaknesses and the former can form a Regenerator core that is very hard to take down while the latter can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Scald", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent target with a 30% chance to burn it.

Scald is preferred over Surf for the potential burn chance it offers, but Surf can still be used to give Slowking as much power as possible. Focus Blast is the preferred choice over Fire Blast, as it has better overall coverage, hitting Dark- and most Steel-type Pokemon for super effective damage. However, Focus Blast's shaky accuracy can be off-putting, and Fire Blast allows Slowking to readily take out Grass- and Steel-type Pokemon. Ice Beam can be used in the third moveslot but Slowking gets more use out of Focus Blast and Fire Blast, as they both have better power and coverage, which is essential considering Slowking has a limited number of turns to attack after setting up Trick Room. Psyshock is Slowking's backup STAB option, allowing it to cover even more Pokemon, targeting Florges and Roserade on their weaker defensive stat. If Psyshock's additional coverage is not needed, Nasty Plot can be used to make Slowking much more threatening under Trick Room. Nasty Plot also allows Slowking to become a greater offensive threat against defensive teams that aren't adversely affected by Trick Room.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>With a Quiet nature and a Speed IV of 0, Slowking is as slow as possible, which allows it to outspeed nearly the entire tier under Trick Room. With maximum HP and Special Attack, Slowking gets the bulk it needs to take hits while being able to hit as hard as possible. Regenerator restores Slowking's HP as it switches out, allowing it to set up Trick Room multiple times in a match if needed. Leftovers increases Slowking's longevity by giving it passive recovery and is the recommended item when running Nasty Plot. Life Orb is still usable, as Regenerator offsets the recoil damage it causes when Slowking attacks. Life Orb also allows Slowking to hit as hard as it possibly can, and it is especially favorable if Nasty Plot is not chosen, as if so, Slowking has no other means of boosting its power. If extra bulk is required, a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 SpD with a Sassy nature can be used, with Nasty Plot to compensate for Slowking's lesser offensive presence. Slack Off can also be used to keep Slowking healthy without the need to switch, but this means it loses offensive potential by giving up either Nasty Plot or one of its coverage options.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Because setting Trick Room up is the primary goal of this Slowking set, use the move as soon as the opportunity presents itself; from there, Slowking can go on the offensive, turning the Speed stats of faster Pokemon against them. If Slowking is running Nasty Plot, it's preferred to use it on a weaker move or a predicted switch, followed by setting up Trick Room afterward. This allows Slowking to have as many offensive turns as possible after setting up, making it an immediate threat for the opponent. Never set Nasty Plot up after using Trick Room unless it's absolutely necessary, because this will cost Slowking a vital turn it could be using to attack. Sadly, Slowking's selection of coverage choices will always leave it walled by something, so adjust your team according to what Slowking has trouble breaking through. With Fire Blast and Psyshock, Slowking will be unable to beat Umbreon and Hydreigon. The combination of Focus Blast and Psyshock leaves Slowking walled by Celebi and Chesnaught to a lesser extent, as Chesnaught's Defense allows it to survive a Psyshock if Life Orb is not chosen. With only Scald and Fire Blast, Slowking is walled by all bulky Water-types in the tier except Swampert, as well as Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Noivern, and Mega Ampharos. With only Scald and Focus Blast, Celebi, Roserade, Noivern, and Chesnaught are able to stop Slowking short. Lastly, Jellicent, and Starmie will wall Slowking by virtue of their typing regardless of what moves Slowking chooses to run.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Slowking's use of Trick Room offers great support to Pokemon who can abuse it for themselves, such as Choice Band Snorlax, Reuniclus, Escavalier, Mega Ampharos, Exploud, and Druddigon. Druddigon, Mega Ampharos, and Escavalier also have notable synergy with Slowking, each covering some of its weaknesses. Pokemon that also set Trick Room, such as Aromatisse, Cofagrigus, Porygon2, and Bronzong, are able to support Slowking as well as the rest of their team.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Trick Room", "desc"=>"For 5 turns, all active Pokemon with lower Speed will move before those with higher Speed, within their priority brackets.

Scald and Psyshock are STAB moves, the former being able to spread burns, and the latter hitting Pokemon such as Florges and Roserade harder. Slack Off gives Slowking a reliable way to regain HP without having to switch out.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given EVs maximize Slowking's physical bulk while giving Slowking a high chance to OHKO offensive Roserade with Psyshock. With a Bold nature, Slowking is able to survive most physical hits easily, though not as well as Suicune. In exchange for lesser physical bulk, however, Slowking has an inherently good Special Defense stat that should not be overlooked; this makes it somewhat of a mixed wall to an extent. Regenerator enables Slowking to recover HP as it switches, which is essential as this is a highly defensive set that relies on having as much HP as possible in order to do its job.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set exchanges better physical bulk for the ability to phaze with Dragon Tail. Take advantage of the phazing support it offers by pairing Slowking with entry hazard setters to help rack up damage throughout the opponent's team. You should also use Dragon Tail to oust Pokemon trying to set up on Slowking, such as Reuniclus and Suicune. As this set takes physical hits better than any of Slowking's other sets, it allows Slowking to more effectively check physical attackers such as Darmanitan, Cobalion, Victini, Crobat, Toxicroak, and Mienshao. Despite Slowking's inherently good Special Defense stat, this set's ability to survive special attacks is poor compared to the Assault Vest set, so try not to let Slowking take them unless it is either absolutely necessary to do so, or they are resisted hits. As Slack Off allows Slowking to recover HP without switching out, take use it to wear down opposing Pokemon passively through recoil or status when applicable.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon such as Cobalion, Mega Aggron, Mega Ampharos, and Chesnaught partner well with physically defensive Slowking, as they can easily switch into Knock Off for it. Chesnaught is a noteworthy partner, as a core of Chesnaught and Slowking can stand up to the majority of the physical attackers in the tier. Slowking's ability to stand up to physical attackers allows it to form a defensive core with Pokemon that can take special attacks, such as Umbreon and Florges. Entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon, Mega Aggron, Forretress, Chesnaught, and Roserade can stack entry hazards to make phazing with Dragon Tail more damaging to the opponent's team. These Pokemon also appreciate Slowking's ability to handle Fire-type moves such as V-create and Flare Blitz from Victini and Darmanitan.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Leftovers", "desc"=>"At the end of every turn, holder restores 1/16 of its max HP.", "id"=>nil, "key"=>"leftovers"}, "moves"=>[{"name"=>"Dragon Tail", "desc"=>"Deals damage to one adjacent target.

It also hits Pokemon that Slowking checks such as Emboar and Moltres for super effective damage. In the second slot, Psyshock is Slowking's secondary STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Roselia, which resist its other STAB moves, pretty hard. Fire Blast rounds off Slowking's coverage and usually OHKOes Escavalier and Doublade after Stealth Rock and does heavy damage to Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangrowth that are not weak to Psyshock. Dragon Tail is the primary option for the last slot as it is useful to phaze Calm Mind Delphox and Reuniclus before they become too much of a threat to your team, though Grass Knot can be used to hit Water-type Pokemon harder than Slowking's other moves.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>248 HP EVs give Slowking a Stealth Rock number and decent all-around bulk thanks to Assault Vest and max Special Attack along with a Modest nature, which is used to let Slowking hit decently hard and take advantage of its great coverage. The leftover EVs are placed in Special Defense to amplify the Assault Vest boost.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>You should use Regenerator and Slowking's resistances to keep it healthy and let it act as an offensive pivot, especially against Choice-locked special attackers. However, remember that this Slowking has no Defense investment, so be careful of Pursuit, Knock Off, and physical attackers that have a neutral STAB move, as they can deal a large amount of damage or outright OHKO Slowking; it should only be used to check Pokemon such as Emboar that can't touch it with their main STAB moves.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This Slowking set is best used in balanced and offensive teams in need of an offensive pivot so Choiced attackers that need something to fall back on when they have to switch out such as Braviary and Delphox are good partners. Entry hazard setters such as Rhyperior for Stealth Rock and Roselia for Spikes have nice synergy with Slowking and are very helpful, as it forces a lot of switches and uses Dragon Tail. On more balanced teams, Aromatisse, which takes Dark- and Bug-type attacks and can get rid of status with Aromatherapy, makes a strong core with Slowking. Drapion and Skuntank are also good partners as they help with Cresselia and Reuniclus which can set up on Slowking if Cresselia or Reuniclus are the last Pokemon or if Slowking lacks Dragon Tail. Gligar appreciates having its Water and Ice weakness covered and can wall physical threats while providing useful Defog support, as multiple layers of Spikes can nullify Regenerator. Amoonguss resists some of Slowking's weaknesses and can form a Regenerator core that is very hard to take down.</p>\n", "item"=>{"name"=>"Assault Vest", "desc"=>"Holder's Sp.

Thunder Wave gives Slowking the ability to support the team by lowering the Speed of many common switch-ins, such as Latias and Venusaur. Between Scald and Thunder Wave, Slowking becomes incredibly difficult to switch in to. Psyshock allows Slowking to take on Keldeo and win in almost every situation, even against the rarer Substitute + Calm Mind Keldeo. Slowking can also dent CroCune with Psyshock. Calm Mind is another option on this set over Thunder Wave in order to defeat CroCune and Tail Glow Manaphy that lack Energy Ball.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread allows Slowking to survive two Sacred Swords from +2 Keldeo while maximizing its special bulk. Using Leftovers instead of Assault Vest allows Slowking to use support moves such as Thunder Wave and Slack Off.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Be very careful switching this set in, especially when Landorus hasn't revealed if it carries Knock Off or Latios hasn't revealed its item. It is best to pivot Slowking in and then immediately apply offensive pressure through Scald and Thunder Wave. Psyshock cannot be spammed as easily on most occasions and should be reserved for hitting things currently on the field as opposed to threatening switch-ins.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>With Thunder Wave, Slowking allows slower wallbreakers to become devastating sweepers. In particular, Mega Gardevoir and Mega Heracross appreciate the Thunder Wave support on levitating Pokemon and Flying-types which are not affected by Sticky Web. The burn support from Scald is also useful for Gardevoir due to its lower physical bulk.</p>\n<p>On more defensive teams, Gliscor is a fantastic teammate, as it can take advantage of slower Pokemon and hit Electric-types with Toxic. While Slowking can take Ice- and Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Keldeo, Gliscor is able to absorb the Electric-, Bug-, and Grass-type attacks that bother Slowking. Pokemon that can do a great deal of damage to Slowking, such as Scizor, fear Gliscor's speedy Taunt set.

Scald is Slowking's main STAB move, as it has decent power and a burn chance that can help getting chip damage on Slowking's checks and potentially crippling switch-ins. Slowking doesn't get Hydro Pump, but Surf is an acceptable alternative as it has a bit more Base Power than Scald. Fire Blast OHKOes Escavalier after Stealth Rock damage and does a lot of damage to Grass-type Pokemon that usually wall Slowking. Psyshock is used for additional STAB coverage and to OHKO most Fighting-type Pokemon that have lower Defense than Special Defense, although Nasty Plot can be used as it gives Slowking sweeping potential and the ability to overpower walls. Slack Off can be used to reliably set up Trick Room throughout the game. Slowking should use a 248 HP / 76 Def / 184 SpD spread with a Sassy nature to take hits from a variety of Pokemon and be very reliable during the game. However, this spread can lead to a loss of momentum as it can't hit very hard and gives a free switch to a lot of Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Reuniclus who can start setting up or heal your opponent's team.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Minimum Speed IVs and a Quiet nature give Slowking 58 Speed, allowing to outspeed everything in the tier.

Bronzong, Cofagrigus, and Reuniclus are also good setters of Trick Room, but they share weaknesses with Slowking. Choice Band Escavalier and Rhyperior are the fastest Pokemon in the tier with Trick Room up and can decimate most offensive teams while being almost impossible to switch into for balanced ones. Exploud has just enough Speed to work well in Trick Room and can decimate everything with STAB Boomburst. Druddigon can hit really hard with STAB Outrage and has really nice synergy with Slowking.

However, Hitmonchan greatly struggles to touch most Ghost-types. Drain Punch is a decently powerful STAB move that provides recovery. Ice Punch provides great coverage, hitting Pokemon such as Gligar and Amoonguss for hefty damage. Fire Punch is used to smack Doublade, but it cannot 2HKO Doublade unless Doublade has had its Eviolite removed. Mach Punch can be used as a form of priority to hit the likes of Sharpedo and Cinccino. Thunder Punch is a decent option to target bulky Water-types such as Slowking and Alomomola.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment are used to hit as hard as possible. An Adamant nature is used because Hitmonchan doesn't outspeed anything significant with a Jolly nature. Maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed as much as possible. Iron Fist is Hitmonchan's best ability, giving a 20% boost to its punching moves. Life Orb is used for a significant increase in power.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Drain Punch is generally the best move to go for, as it hits fairly hard with the Iron Fist boost, and most switch-ins to the Fighting-type are generally outsped and can be hit by the appropriate coverage move. Use Rapid Spin if entry hazards need to be cleared from the field for a Flying- or Fire-type teammate such as Fletchinder or Moltres. However, if the opponent has a Ghost-type, using Rapid Spin is a waste of time.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Fire- and Flying-types such as Moltres and Braviary have good synergy with Hitmonchan and appreciate the Rapid Spin support. Steel-types such as Escavalier and Doublade are helpful to switch into Flying-, Fairy-, and Psychic-type attacks. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Rhyperior and Druddigon is useful to wear down the opponent's switch-ins. For example, Hitmonchan 2HKOes Rhyperior with Drain Punch after Stealth Rock damage.
